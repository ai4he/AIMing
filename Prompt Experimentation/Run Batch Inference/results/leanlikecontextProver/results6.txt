Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any pair of vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
ccl(G): A function that returns the order (i.e., the number of vertices) of the largest complete minor in graph G.
b: A parameter defined as b := 1/(1-p).
ε (epsilon): An arbitrarily small positive constant used to frame the precision of the result (e.g., in (1 ± ε)).
C: A constant, whose value depends on ε, that defines the lower bound for the average degree (np) in the main theorem.
c: A fixed constant greater than 1, used to define the edge probability in the sparse case (p = c/n).
δ (delta): A constant, whose value depends on the constant c.

Assumptions
The results are presented as theorems that hold under specific constraints on the parameters. The key assumptions are the conditions stated in the "if" part of the theorems.
Asymptotic Analysis: All results are for the limit where n (the number of vertices) tends to infinity. The conclusions hold "asymptotically almost surely" (a.a.s.), meaning with a probability that approaches 1 as n grows.
Conditions on Edge Probability p:
For Corollary 1.3, it is assumed that the edge probability p is in the range C/n ≤ p ≤ 1-ε. This means the average degree (np) is at least some large constant C, and p is bounded away from 1.
For Theorem 1.4, it is assumed that the edge probability p is exactly p = c/n, where c is a fixed constant greater than 1. 



    Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you will write:
 })=(1 \pm \eps)n/\sqrt{\log_b n}$,
where $b:=1/(1-p)$. Here~$G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on~$n$ vertices
where the edges are present independently and with probability~$p$.
We say that an event occurs \emph{asymptotically almost surely} (a.a.s.)
if it occurs with probability tending to~$1$ as~$n$ tends to infinity.

Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} considered the order of the largest
complete minor in a sparser random graph (and more generally in arbitrary
pseudo-random and expanding graphs).
%They observed that the proof in~\cite{BCE} can be extended to the case
%$p 	o 0$ as long as $p$ is not too small, but that it breaks down eventually.
They determined the order of magnitude of~ccl$(G_{n,p})$
as long as~$p\ge n^{\eps-1}$. Our first result determines~ccl$(G_{n,p})$ asymptotically
as long as $p\ge C/n$ and $p=o(1)$.

egin{thm}\label{thmdense}
For every $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $pn\ge C$
and $p=o(1)$, then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) \sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}}. $$
\end{thm}

One can combine Theorem~ef{thmdense} with~\cite{BCE} to obtain
a single formula which allows for constant~$p$ as well. Indeed, let $b:=1/(1-p)$.
If $p=o(1)$ a series expansion gives $\ln b=-\ln (1-p)=p+O(p^2)$.
Thus
$$
\sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}} = \sqrt{rac{n^2 p}{\ln b\log_b (np)}}
=(1+o(1)){n \over \sqrt{\log_b (np)}}.
$$
Also if~$p$ is constant, then $\log_b n=(1+o(1))\log_b(np)$.
So altogether we obtain the following.
egin{corollary}\label{thmdense1}
For every  $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $C/n \le p \le 1-\eps$,
then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) rac{n}{\sqrt{\log_{b} (np)}}. $$
\end{corollary}

In the last section of the paper, we estimate~ccl$(G_{n,c/n})$ where $c>1$ is fixed.
Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} observed that there are constants~$c_1$ and~$c_2$
such that $c_1\sqrt{n /\log n}\le {m ccl}(G_{n,c/n})\le c_2\sqrt{n}$
and asked what the correct order of magnitude is.
 



Task:
Based on the context, objects and assumptions above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #6 ---
### 1. Understanding the Context and Objects

We are dealing with random graphs \( G_{n,p} \), where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge independently with probability \( p \). The paper is discussing the largest complete minor (i.e., the largest set of vertices that induce a complete subgraph) in such random graphs under different edge probability \( p \) regimes.

Key objects and parameters:
- \( G \): A general graph.
- \( n \): Number of vertices.
- \( p \): Edge probability in \( G_{n,p} \).
- \( G_{n,p} \): A random graph with \( n \) vertices and edge probability \( p \).
- \( \text{ccl}(G) \): The order of the largest complete minor (subgraph) in \( G \).
- \( b = 1/(1 - p) \).
- \( \epsilon \): Arbitrarily small positive constant.
- \( C \): Constant depending on \( \epsilon \), bounding the average degree \( np \).
- \( c \): Fixed constant, \( c > 1 \), used for \( p = c/n \) in the sparse case.
- \( \delta \): Constant depending on \( c \).

### 2. Identifying the Core Mathematical Statement

The paper is primarily concerned with the order of the largest complete minor \( \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) \) in \( G_{n,p} \) under different edge probability regimes:
1. **Dense Regime (Theorem 1.4)**: \( p \approx 1 \) (but \( p = o(1) \) is allowed).
2. **Intermediate Regime (Corollary 1.3)**: \( p \) is bounded away from 0 and 1.
3. **Sparse Regime (Theorem 1.5 and Corollary 1.4)**: \( p = c/n \) for fixed \( c > 1 \).

Our goal is to extract a theorem that could be useful for the general context of the paper.

### 3. Formulating a Useful Theorem

One possible theorem that could be useful in the paper is a general asymptotic result for \( \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) \) in \( G_{n,p} \) as \( n \to \infty \):

**Theorem**: For any fixed \( \epsilon > 0 \), the largest complete minor \( \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) \) in \( G_{n,p} \) satisfies:
\[ \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) = (1 \pm \epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_b n}} \]
asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.), where \( b = 1/(1 - p) \), provided \( p \in [C/n, 1 - \epsilon] \) for some constant \( C = C(\epsilon) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. The result relies on the probability of a random graph having a large complete minor.
2. The proof combines known results about random graphs and Turán-type problems.
3. The asymptotic behavior is derived by analyzing the probability of forming a large complete minor.

### 4. Formalizing the Theorem

Here is the formal theorem statement:

**Theorem**:
For every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a constant \( C = C(\epsilon) \) such that if \( p \geq C / n \) and \( p = o(1) \), then asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.):
\[ \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) = (1 \pm \epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_b n}} \]
where \( b = 1 / (1 - p) \).

### 5. Explanation

1. **Interpretation**: The theorem states that when \( p \) is not too small (bounded below by \( C / n \)), the largest complete minor in \( G_{n,p} \) has order \( \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_b n}} \) up to a \( 1 \pm \epsilon \) factor. This is derived by combining known results about random graphs and Turán-type extremal problems.

2. **Connection to the Paper**: This theorem is a generalization of the results in the paper, especially Corollary 1.3 and Theorem 1.4. The sparse case (\( p = c/n \)) is covered in a separate theorem or corollary.

3. **Application**: This theorem can be used to prove asymptotic results about \( \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) \) in the given edge probability regimes.

### 6. Proof Sketch for the Theorem

The proof would typically involve the following steps:
1. Estimate the probability that a random graph does not contain a large complete minor of size \( (1 \pm \epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_b n}} \).
2. Show that this probability tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \).
3. Conclude that the largest complete minor must satisfy the given size asymptotically almost surely.

### 7. Summary

The theorem provides a unified asymptotic result for the largest complete minor in a random graph \( G_{n,p} \) under moderate edge probability regimes. The proof would require combining probabilistic tools with combinatorial bounds on Turán-type problems.

### 8. Formal Theorem in Lean4

```lean4
theorem largest_complete_minor_asymptotic (ε : ℝ) (ε_pos : ε > 0) (C : ℝ) (C_pos : C > 0) 
  (hC : ∀ (p : ℝ), p ≥ C → p = o(1) → p ≥ 0) : 
  ∃ (b : ℝ), ∀ (n p : ℝ), n ≥ 1 → p ≥ C / n → p = o(1) → 
  (∀ (G : Type), [Fintype G] → [DecidableEq G] → 
    let G_np := G.mkFinset (Finset.univ : Finset G) in 
    let ccl := largest_complete_minor G_np in 
    a.a.s. (ccl = (1 ± ε) * n / Real.sqrt (Real.logb b n))) := by
  sorry
```

### Explanation of Lean4 Formalization:
1. The theorem states that for any \( \epsilon > 0 \) and \( C > 0 \), there exists a \( b \) (related to \( p \)) such that under the given conditions on \( p \), the largest complete minor \( \text{ccl}(G_{n,p}) \) is \( (1 \pm \epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_b n}} \) asymptotically almost surely.
2. The `largest_complete_minor` function is assumed to exist and represent the largest complete subgraph in a graph.
3. The condition `p = o(1)` is used to restrict `p` to be sufficiently small.
4. The proof would require translating the asymptotic probabilistic bounds into Lean4 syntax, which is non-trivial due to the lack of built-in tools for a.a.s. statements in Lean4.
