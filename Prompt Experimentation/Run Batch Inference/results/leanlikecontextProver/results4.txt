Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
n: A large integer representing the dimension of the matrices.
M_n: An n x n complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables. This is the main object of study.
Singular Matrix: A square matrix whose determinant is zero. The probability of this event is the central quantity to be bounded.
p: A constant between 0 and 1, representing an upper bound on the probability that a random variable takes any single value.
r: A constant positive integer, used as an exponent in the main property definition.
p-bounded of exponent r: A key technical property defined for the distribution of the random entries of the matrix M_n. A random variable ξ is p-bounded of exponent r if there is no value z_0 such that P(ξ = z_0) > p, and for any r distinct values z_1, ..., z_r, the probability P(ξ ∈ {z_1, ..., z_r}) is bounded away from 1 by a constant.
Integral Domain of Characteristic Zero: An algebraic structure (like the integers or complex numbers) where the main results hold.

Assumptions
Large n: The results are asymptotic, holding as n (the matrix dimension) tends to infinity.
Independent Entries: The entries of the random matrix M_n are assumed to be mutually independent random variables. They are not required to be identically distributed.
Discrete Distribution: The random entries of M_n take values from a discrete set of complex numbers.
p-bounded Property: The main theorem assumes that the distributions of the matrix entries satisfy the p-bounded of exponent r property for some constants p and r. This property ensures that the random variables are "not too concentrated" on any single value or on any small set of values.



    Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you will write:
 entries of $M_n$ satisfy this property, then
the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $\lt(p^{1/r} + o(1)\rt)^n$.
All of the results in this paper hold for any characteristic zero integral
domain replacing the complex numbers.


In the special case where the entries of $M_n$ are  ``fair coin flips''
(taking the values $+1,-1$ each with probability $1/2$), our general bound
implies that the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most
$\lt(\frac{1}{\sqrt2}+o(1)\rt)^n$, improving on the previous best upper bound
of $\lt(\frac{3}{4}+o(1)\rt)^n$, proved by Tao and Vu \cite{TV2}.


In the special case where the entries of $M_n$ are  ``lazy coin flips''
(taking values $+1,-1$ each with probability $1/4$ and value 0 with probability $1/2$), our general bound implies  that
the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most
$\lt(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\rt)^n$, which is asymptotically sharp.

Our method is a refinement of those  from \cite{KKS} and \cite{TV2}. In
particular,  we  make a critical use of the Structure Theorem from
\cite{TV2}, which was obtained using tools from additive combinatorics.

\section {Introduction}\label{s:intro}

Let $n$ be a large integer and $M_n$ be an $n$ by $n$ random matrix whose
entries are independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) discrete
random variables taking values in the complex numbers. The problem of
estimating the probability that $M_{n}$ is singular is a basic problem in the
theory of random matrices and combinatorics.  The goal of this paper is to
give a bound that applies to a large variety of distributions. The general
statement (Theorem~\ref{main theorem}) is a bit technical, so we will first
discuss a few corollaries concerning special cases.


The most famous special  case is when the entries of $M_{n}$ are
independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables
(taking values $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$). The following conjecture has
been open for quite some time: 



Task:
Based on the context, objects and assumptions above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

### 1.1 A General Bound for Random Matrices with p-Bounded Entries

**Theorem (General Bound on Singular Probability for Random Matrices with p-Bounded Entries)**

Let $n$ be a large integer, and $M_n$ be an $n \times n$ complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables. Suppose that the distribution of each entry $\xi_{ij}$ satisfies the following property:

1. **p-Bounded of Exponent r Property**: For any positive constants $p \in (0,1)$ and $r \in \mathbb{N}^+$, there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for any finite subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, the probability $\mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} \in S)$ is bounded away from 1, and for any multiset $\{z_1, z_2,..., z_r\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, the probability $\mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} \in \{z_1,..., z_r\})$ is at most $C \cdot r^p$.

2. **Large Deviation Property**: For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta = \delta(\epsilon) > 0$ such that $\mathbb{P}(|\xi_{ij}| > n^\delta) \leq \epsilon$ for all $i,j$.

Then, the probability that $M_n$ is singular (i.e., $\det(M_n) = 0$) is at most $(p^{1/r} + o(1))^n$ as $n \to \infty$.

**Proof Sketch**:
The theorem follows from the general framework developed in \cite{TV2} for random matrices with independent entries. The key steps involve:

1. **Structure Theorem (from \cite{TV2})**: Under the given p-boundedness condition, the entries of $M_n$ are "spread out" in a way that ensures that the matrix is not too likely to be singular.
2. **Probabilistic Estimate**: The probability that $M_n$ is singular is controlled by the probability that any submatrix of $M_n$ is singular. The structure theorem ensures that these submatrices cannot be too close to being singular, leading to the desired bound.

### 1.2 Special Cases and Examples

1. **Bernoulli Case**: If the entries are i.i.d. Bernoulli with $\mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} = 1) = \mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} = -1) = 1/2$, then the theorem gives the bound $(2^{-1/2} + o(1))^n$ for the probability of singularity. This is better than the previously known bound $(\frac{3}{4} + o(1))^n$ (from \cite{TV2}).
2. **Lazy Coin Flips Case**: If the entries are i.i.d. with $\mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} = 1) = \mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} = -1) = 1/4$ and $\mathbb{P}(\xi_{ij} = 0) = 1/2$, then the theorem gives the sharp bound $(1/2 + o(1))^n$ for the probability of singularity.

### 1.3 Implications for Other Field Extensions

The theorem holds for any characteristic zero integral domain $\mathbb{F}$ replacing $\mathbb{C}$, including $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, and finite fields. This is because the structure theorem and large deviation condition are purely algebraic properties that do not rely on any specific field properties.

### 1.4 Conclusion and Future Directions

This work provides a general bound on the probability that a random matrix is singular under certain conditions on the distribution of its entries. The bound is sharp in several special cases and improves over previous bounds in others. The method of proof is based on the Structure Theorem from \cite{TV2} and extends it to more general distributions.

### 2.0 Step-by-Step Abstract Plan for the Proof

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to bound the probability that a random $n \times n$ matrix with independent discrete entries is singular.
2. **Use Structure Theorems**: Leverage the Structure Theorem from \cite{TV2} to understand the behavior of singular submatrices.
3. **Bound the Probability of Singularity**: Use the Structure Theorem to bound the probability that any submatrix of $M_n$ is singular, and then use inclusion-exclusion to bound the probability that $M_n$ is singular.
4. **Combine with Large Deviation Condition**: The large deviation condition ensures that entries do not take extreme values, which helps in bounding the probability of singularity.
5. **Special Case Analysis**: Verify the bound in special cases to ensure it is sharp and correct.

### 3.0 Rigorously Formulate the Theorem

**Theorem**: Let $n$ be a large integer, and $M_n$ be an $n \times n$ complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables. Suppose that:
1. For any multiset $\{z_1,..., z_r\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, the probability that any entry $\xi_{ij}$ equals one of the $z_i$'s is at most $C \cdot r^p$ for some constants $C, p > 0$.
2. For any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\mathbb{P}(|\xi_{ij}| > n^\delta) \leq \epsilon$ for all $i,j$.

Then, the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $(p^{1/r} + o(1))^n$ as $n \to \infty$.

### 4.0 Abstract Plan for the Proof

1. **Structure Theorem**: The matrix $M_n$ can be decomposed into a sum of "small" and "large" parts, where the small parts do not contribute significantly to singularity.
2. **Probability Estimate**: The probability that any submatrix of $M_n$ is singular is bounded.
3. **Inclusion-Exclusion**: The probability that $M_n$ is singular is bounded by the sum of probabilities that its submatrices are singular.
4. **Large Deviation**: The large deviation condition ensures that entries do not take extreme values, which helps in bounding the probability of singularity.
5. **Final Bound**: Combine the above steps to get the desired bound.

### 6.0 Detailed Abstract Plan

1. **Decompose the Matrix**:
   - Use the Structure Theorem to decompose $M_n$ into a sum of small and large parts.
   - The small part is "almost deterministic" and contributes negligibly to singularity.
   - The large part is controlled by the p-boundedness condition.

2. **Bound the Probability of Singularity**:
   - The probability that the small part is singular is negligible.
   - The probability that the large part is singular is bounded by the p-boundedness condition.
   - Combine these bounds using inclusion-exclusion.

3. **Combine All Conditions**:
   - Use the large deviation condition to ensure entries do not take extreme values.
   - Combine all bounds to get the final result.
