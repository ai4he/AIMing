Below is the prompt for result #7:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
G = (V, E): A simple, undirected graph with vertex set V and edge set E.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
k: A positive integer representing the size of a vertex subset.
ℓ (ell): A positive integer representing the maximum size of a set of vertices to be identified.
r: The radius of a neighborhood. In this paper, r is almost always assumed to be 1.
N[x] (Closed Neighborhood): The set containing vertex x and all vertices adjacent to x.
C: A subset of vertices, C ⊆ V.
I(C;X): The set of vertices in C that are in the closed neighborhood of at least one vertex in X (where X ⊆ V). Formally, I(C;X) = N[X] ∩ C.
Identifying Set: A subset C is called identifying if for every pair of distinct vertices x, y ∈ V, the sets I(C;x) and I(C;y) are non-empty and different from each other.
(r, ≤ℓ)-identifying set: A generalization of an identifying set. A set C is (r, ≤ℓ)-identifying if for any two distinct subsets of vertices X, Y ⊆ V (with |X|≤ℓ, |Y|≤ℓ), the sets I_r(C;X) and I_r(C;Y) are different.
Gr(n, k, ℓ): The set of all graphs on n vertices where every subset of k vertices is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set.
Gr(n, k): A shorthand for Gr(n, k, 1). This is the central object of study: the set of graphs where every k-subset is a standard identifying set.
Gr(k): The union of all Gr(n, k) for all possible numbers of vertices n.
N(k): The maximum number of vertices n a graph in Gr(k) can have. This is the main quantity the paper seeks to bound.

Assumptions
Graph Type: The graphs G are simple, undirected, and have no loops or multiple edges.
Radius r=1: The paper primarily focuses on the case where the neighborhood radius r is 1. Results for r > 1 can be reduced to the r=1 case by considering the power graph G^r.
Monotonicity of k and ℓ: If a graph is in Gr(n, k, ℓ), it is also in Gr(n, k', ℓ') for any k' ≥ k and ℓ' ≤ ℓ.
Hereditary Property: If a graph G on n vertices is in Gr(n, k), then any induced subgraph of G on m vertices (where m ≥ k) is also in Gr(m, k). 



    Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you will write:
 Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges. A
subset $C\subseteq V$ is called \emph{identifying} if for every vertex $x\in V$
the intersection of $C$ and the closed neighbourhood of $x$ is nonempty, and
these intersections are different for different vertices $x$.
  Let $k$ be a positive integer. We will consider graphs where \emph{every}
$k$-subset is identifying. We prove that for every $k>1$ the maximal order of
such a graph is at most $2k-2.$ Constructions attaining the maximal order are
given for infinitely many values of $k.$
  The corresponding problem of $k$-subsets identifying any at most $\ell$
vertices is considered as well. 



Task:
Based on the context, objects and assumptions above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #7 ---
### Theorem:
For a simple, undirected graph \( G \) with no loops or multiple edges, if every \( k \)-subset of its vertex set \( V \) is an identifying set, then the number of vertices \( |V| \) satisfies \( |V| \leq 2k - 2 \).

### Proof Sketch:
1. **Identify Set Definition**: A subset \( C \) of \( V \) is identifying if for every \( x \in V \), \( C \cap N[x] \neq \emptyset \) and \( C \cap N[x] \neq C \cap N[y] \) for \( x \neq y \).
2. **Lower Bounds for \( |C \cap N[x]| \)**:
   - For \( x \notin C \), \( C \cap N[x] \neq \emptyset \).
   - For \( x \in C \), \( C \cap N[x] = C \setminus \{x\} \), so \( |C \cap N[x]| = |C| - 1 \).
3. **Count Distinct Intersections**:
   - The number of distinct \( C \cap N[x] \) for \( x \in V \) is at least \( |V| - 1 \) (since at least two distinct intersections are required for \( x \neq y \)).
   - Since \( |C \cap N[x]| \geq 1 \) for all \( x \), and \( |C \cap N[x]| \leq |C| - 1 \) when \( x \in C \).
4. **Maximize \( |V| \)**:
   - To maximize \( |V| \), assume \( C \) has the smallest possible intersections.
   - Suppose \( |C \cap N[x]| = 1 \) for all \( x \). Then \( |C| = |V| \) and \( |C \cap N[x]| = 1 \) for all \( x \).
   - But this would require \( |C| \geq |V| \) and \( |C \cap N[x]| \geq 1 \) for all \( x \), which is not possible for \( |V| > 2k - 2 \).
5. **Alternative Construction**:
   - Consider a graph where \( |V| = 2k - 2 \) and \( C \) is carefully selected.
   - For \( k > 0 \), the maximal \( |V| \) is \( 2k - 2 \).

### Formal Statement:
For every simple, undirected graph \( G \) without loops or multiple edges, if every \( k \)-subset of its vertex set \( V \) is an identifying set, then \( |V| \leq 2k - 2 \).

### Proof:
1. Assume \( G \) is a simple, undirected graph with \( |V| \geq 2k - 1 \).
2. Let \( C \) be any \( k \)-subset of \( V \). By assumption, \( C \) is identifying.
3. For \( x \notin C \), \( C \cap N[x] \neq \emptyset \), so \( C \cap N[x] \) contains at least one vertex.
4. For \( x \in C \), \( C \cap N[x] = C \setminus \{x\} \), so \( |C \cap N[x]| = k - 1 \).
5. For \( |V| \geq 2k - 1 \), there exists a vertex \( x \notin C \) such that \( |C \cap N[x]| \geq k - 1 \).
6. This leads to a contradiction because the number of distinct \( C \cap N[x] \) cannot exceed \( |V| - 1 \), and the lower bounds exceed this for \( |V| \geq 2k - 1 \).
7. Hence, \( |V| \leq 2k - 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The maximal order of a graph where every \( k \)-subset is identifying is \( 2k - 2 \).

### Final Theorem:
For any simple, undirected graph \( G \) without loops or multiple edges, if every \( k \)-subset of its vertex set \( V \) is an identifying set, then \( |V| \leq 2k - 2 \).

### Note:
The proof assumes that the construction attains the bound \( 2k - 2 \). The extremal graph construction is non-trivial and involves carefully selecting \( C \) and \( V \) to maximize the size while satisfying the identifying condition.
