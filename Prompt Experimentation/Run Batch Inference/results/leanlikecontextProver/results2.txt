Below is the prompt for result #2:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
Set Partition of [n]: A collection of disjoint, non-empty subsets (called "blocks") whose union is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
Arc: In the visual representation of a set partition, an arc connects two consecutive elements within the same block.
[n]: The set of integers {1, 2, ..., n}.
[±n]: The set of integers {1, 2, ..., n, -1, -2, ..., -n}.
Set Partition of Type A_n: A standard set partition of [n].
Set Partition of Type B_n or C_n: A set partition of [±n] that is symmetric (if a block B is present, then -B is also present) and has at most one "zero block" (a block B_0 for which B_0 = -B_0).
Set Partition of Type D_n: A set partition of type B_n where the zero block, if it exists, is not a simple pair {i, -i}.
Crossing: A pair of arcs (i, j) and (i', j') such that i < i' < j < j'.
Nesting: A pair of arcs (i, j) and (i', j') such that i < i' < j' < j.
Non-crossing/Non-nesting Partition: A partition with zero crossings or zero nestings, respectively.
Maximal Crossing/Nesting: A set of the largest possible size of arcs that are all mutually crossing or mutually nesting.
Openers op(B): The set of all non-maximal elements in the blocks of a partition B.
Closers cl(B): The set of all non-minimal elements in the blocks of a partition B.
Opener-Closer Configuration: A pair of sets (O, C) that can be realized as the openers and closers of some set partition.
Nesting Order (for Type C): The ordering 1 < 2 < ... < n < -n < ... < -2 < -1.
Crossing Order (for Type C): The ordering 1 < 2 < ... < n < -1 < -2 < ... < -n.

Assumptions
Visualization Convention: Set partitions are visualized by placing the numbers on a line and drawing arcs above them to connect consecutive elements of each block.
Classical Types: The paper focuses on set partitions corresponding to the classical Coxeter groups/reflection groups of types A, B, C, and D.
Symmetry in Type B/C/D: Partitions of types B, C, and D must obey a specific symmetry property with respect to negation: if B is a block, then so is -B = {-b | b ∈ B}.
Order-Dependent Definitions: The definitions of "crossing" and "nesting" for types other than A depend on specific, pre-defined orderings of the elements in [±n] (the "crossing order" and "nesting order").
Arc Definition in Type C: In the visual diagrams for Type C partitions, arcs are drawn by connecting elements that are consecutive in the nesting order, even when the elements on the line are arranged in the crossing order.

\label{sec:cross-nest-A}

One of the goals of this article is to refine the following well known correspondences between
non-crossing and non-nesting set partitions.  For ordinary set partitions, a
\Dfn{crossing} consists of a pair of arcs $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ such that
$i<i'<j<j'$:

On the other hand, if $i<i'<j'<j$, we have a \Dfn{nesting}, pictorially:

    \put(4.75,0){\hbox{$i'$}}
    \put(5.75,0){\hbox{$<$}}
    \put(7,0){\hbox{$j'$}}
    \put(8,0){\hbox{$<$}}
    \put(9.25,0){\hbox{$j$}}

A set partition of $[n]$ is called \Dfn{non-crossing} (resp. \Dfn{non-nesting})
if the number of crossings (resp. the number of nestings) equals $0$.

It has been known for a long time that the numbers of non-crossing and
non-nesting set-partitions of $[n]$ coincide.  More recently, Anisse Kasraoui
and Jiang Zeng have shown in~\cite{KasraouiZeng2006} that much more is true:
  



Task:
Based on the context, objects and assumptions above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #2 ---
### Theorem Statement

**Theorem:**  
The number of non-crossing set partitions of type $A$ on $[n]$ is equal to the number of non-nesting set partitions of type $A$ on $[n]$.

---

### Proof Sketch

The theorem is a direct consequence of the symmetry and equivalence of the crossing and nesting counts in set partitions of type $A$. Here's why:

1. **Combinatorial Interpretation of Crossing and Nesting:**
   - A crossing $(i, j)$ and $(i', j')$ is a pair of arcs where the first arc is followed by another arc that has a smaller arc crossing it.
   - Similarly, a nesting $(i, j)$ and $(i', j')$ is a pair of arcs where the first arc is followed by another arc that has a larger arc within it.

2. **Symmetry in Crossing and Nesting:**
   - The number of crossings in a set partition is equal to the number of nestings in its dual partition, where the dual operation swaps the arcs' order.
   - Therefore, the total number of crossings is equal to the total number of nestings in the original partition.

3. **Non-crossing and Non-nesting:**
   - A partition is non-crossing if it has no crossings.
   - Similarly, it is non-nesting if it has no nestings.
   - By the above, the number of non-crossing partitions is equal to the number of non-nesting partitions.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The bijection between crossings and nestings implies that the counts are equal.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Define Crossing and Nesting:**
   - Describe crossing and nesting in terms of arc configurations in a set partition.

2. **Symmetry Argument:**
   - Show that crossings and nestings are dual concepts in set partitions.
   - Specifically, each crossing in a partition corresponds to a nesting in its dual.

3. **Counting Equivalence:**
   - Conclude that the number of crossings is equal to the number of nestings.
   - Hence, the number of non-crossing partitions equals the number of non-nesting partitions.

### Step-by-Step Justification

Here's the breakdown of the proof:

1. **Crossing and Nesting Definitions:**
   - A crossing is a pair of arcs $(i, j), (i', j')$ where $i < i' < j < j'$ (i.e., the first arc is followed by another arc that has a smaller arc crossing it).
   - A nesting is a pair of arcs $(i, j), (i', j')$ where $i < i' < j' < j$ (i.e., the first arc is followed by another arc that has a larger arc nesting it).

2. **Duality between Crossing and Nesting:**
   - Consider the dual set partition, obtained by swapping the order of arcs.
   - Every crossing in the original partition becomes a nesting in the dual, and vice versa.

3. **Non-crossing and Non-nesting:**
   - A partition is non-crossing if it has no crossings.
   - A partition is non-nesting if it has no nestings.
   - By the bijection, the number of non-crossing partitions equals the number of non-nesting partitions.

### Formal Theorem

**Theorem:**  
For a set partition of type $A$ on $[n]$, the number of non-crossing partitions is equal to the number of non-nesting partitions.

---

### Final Answer

The theorem is:

```lean4
theorem noncrossing_eq_nonnesting_for_type_A : 
  ∀ (n : ℕ), 
  Nat.card {σ : SetPartition (Fin n) | σ.isNonCrossing} = 
  Nat.card {σ : SetPartition (Fin n) | σ.isNonNesting} := by
  sorry
```

This formalizes the theorem by stating that the number of non-crossing set partitions of type $A$ on $[n]$ is equal to the number of non-nesting set partitions of type $A$ on $[n]$. The proof would rely on the bijection between crossings and nestings as described above.
