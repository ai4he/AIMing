Below is the prompt for result #1:
Given the following objects, assumptions and context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects
N = (V, A, r, X): An X-network, which is a rooted, acyclic directed graph (digraph). V is the set of vertices, A is the set of arcs (directed edges), r is the root vertex, and X is the set of leaves, typically representing species or taxa.
Arc: An ordered pair of vertices (u, v), representing a directed connection from u to v.
CSD map (Connected Surjective Digraph map): A function ϕ: N → N' between two networks that maps vertices to vertices. It must be surjective (onto) and preserve connectivity in a specific way: the inverse image of any vertex in N' must be a connected set of vertices in N.
Restricted Set: A non-empty set of vertices B that represents a "bottleneck". Formally, there is at most one vertex w' outside of B that has an arc pointing into B. If such a w' exists, it is called the anchor of B.
R(v): The smallest restricted set containing a given vertex v. This is constructed by a specific algorithm provided in the paper.
Restricted CSD map: A CSD map ϕ: N → N' where the inverse image of every vertex in N' is a restricted set in N.
ResTr(N) (Restricted Tree of N): The main object constructed by the paper. It is a well-defined tree derived from a network N by partitioning N's vertices into the sets R(v) and forming a quotient graph. It serves as a canonical simplification of N.

Assumptions
Network Structure: The networks N are assumed to be rooted, acyclic, and finite directed graphs. All vertices are assumed to be ancestral to at least one leaf.
Bottleneck Definition: The core concept of a "restricted set" formalizes the intuitive notion of a bottleneck in the network's information or evolutionary flow. A set has restricted entry if there's only one "way in" from the outside.
Existence of an Algorithm: The paper assumes the existence and well-definedness of an algorithm that, for any vertex v, computes the smallest restricted set R(v) containing it.
Universal Property: The constructed tree ResTr(N) is claimed to have a "universal" property, meaning any other simplification of N via a restricted CSD map must factor through ResTr(N). This makes ResTr(N) a canonical or fundamental simplification.

Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you write:
 human population forms a tight cluster.  If $N$ is successively cluster-distinct, the same argument would suggest that it forms a restricted set.

A restricted CSD map $f: N \to N'$ is \emph{universal (for restricted maps)} provided that given any restricted map $g: N \to N''$  there is a unique restricted CSD map $h: N' \to N''$ such that $g = h \circ f$.

We shall see below that the natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is universal for restricted maps.

The first result is that the image of a restricted map is always a tree.

\begin{thm}%4.1
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network and let $T = (V',A',r',X)$ be an $X$-network.  Assume $f: N \to T$ is a restricted CSD map.  Then $T$ is a tree.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We show that $T$ has no hybrid vertices.  Suppose otherwise, so we may assume $V'$ contains distinct vertices $u_1'$, $u_2'$, and $u_3'$ while $A'$ contains arcs $(u_1',u_3')$, $(u_2', u_3')$.  Let $B_i = f^{-1}(u_i')$.  Since $f$ is restricted, each $B_i$ is a restricted set.  Since $f$ is a CSD map, there exist $u_1 \in B_1$, $w_1 \in B_3$, $u_2 \in B_2$, and  $w_2 \in B_3$ such that $(u_1,w_1)$ and $(u_2,w_2)$ are arcs of $N$.  Note $u_1 \notin B_3$ and $u_2 \notin B_3$.  Since $B_3$ is restricted, it follows $u_1 = Anc(B_3)$ and $u_2 = Anc(B_3)$.  Hence $u_1 = u_2$ so $u_1' = f(u_1) = f(u_2) = u_2'$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}%Cor 4.2.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  Then $ResTr(N)$ is an $X$-tree.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is a restricted CSD map.
\end{proof}


The next result shows that many relationships among leaves observed in $ResTr(N)$ are also present in $N$.

\begin{cor}%Cor 4.3.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  There is a wired lift of $ResTr(N)$ into $N$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Theorem 2.5.
\end{proof}


Restricted maps have interesting functorial properties, as seen in the next results. 



--- Model Generation for result #1 ---
%THM 4.4<｜Assistant｜>[Uniqueness]
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  The tree $ResTr(N)$ is unique up to isomorphism.  In particular, any two CSD maps from $N$ to a tree $T$ are equal.
