Below is the prompt for result #1:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
 human population forms a tight cluster.  If $N$ is successively cluster-distinct, the same argument would suggest that it forms a restricted set.

A restricted CSD map $f: N \to N'$ is \emph{universal (for restricted maps)} provided that given any restricted map $g: N \to N''$  there is a unique restricted CSD map $h: N' \to N''$ such that $g = h \circ f$.

We shall see below that the natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is universal for restricted maps.

The first result is that the image of a restricted map is always a tree.

\begin{thm}%4.1
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network and let $T = (V',A',r',X)$ be an $X$-network.  Assume $f: N \to T$ is a restricted CSD map.  Then $T$ is a tree.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We show that $T$ has no hybrid vertices.  Suppose otherwise, so we may assume $V'$ contains distinct vertices $u_1'$, $u_2'$, and $u_3'$ while $A'$ contains arcs $(u_1',u_3')$, $(u_2', u_3')$.  Let $B_i = f^{-1}(u_i')$.  Since $f$ is restricted, each $B_i$ is a restricted set.  Since $f$ is a CSD map, there exist $u_1 \in B_1$, $w_1 \in B_3$, $u_2 \in B_2$, and  $w_2 \in B_3$ such that $(u_1,w_1)$ and $(u_2,w_2)$ are arcs of $N$.  Note $u_1 \notin B_3$ and $u_2 \notin B_3$.  Since $B_3$ is restricted, it follows $u_1 = Anc(B_3)$ and $u_2 = Anc(B_3)$.  Hence $u_1 = u_2$ so $u_1' = f(u_1) = f(u_2) = u_2'$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}%Cor 4.2.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  Then $ResTr(N)$ is an $X$-tree.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is a restricted CSD map.
\end{proof}


The next result shows that many relationships among leaves observed in $ResTr(N)$ are also present in $N$.

\begin{cor}%Cor 4.3.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  There is a wired lift of $ResTr(N)$ into $N$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Theorem 2.5.
\end{proof}


Restricted maps have interesting functorial properties, as seen in the next results.  

--- Model Generation for result #1 ---
%5.1
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network, and let $f: N \to N'$ be a restricted CSD map.  Then $\phi': N' \to ResTr(N')$ is a restricted CSD map.  Furthermore, $\phi \circ f: N \to ResTr(N')$ is a restricted CSD map.
