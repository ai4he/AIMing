Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
 })=(1 \pm \eps)n/\sqrt{\log_b n}$,
where $b:=1/(1-p)$. Here~$G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on~$n$ vertices
where the edges are present independently and with probability~$p$.
We say that an event occurs \emph{asymptotically almost surely} (a.a.s.)
if it occurs with probability tending to~$1$ as~$n$ tends to infinity.

Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} considered the order of the largest
complete minor in a sparser random graph (and more generally in arbitrary
pseudo-random and expanding graphs).
%They observed that the proof in~\cite{BCE} can be extended to the case
%$p 	o 0$ as long as $p$ is not too small, but that it breaks down eventually.
They determined the order of magnitude of~ccl$(G_{n,p})$
as long as~$p\ge n^{\eps-1}$. Our first result determines~ccl$(G_{n,p})$ asymptotically
as long as $p\ge C/n$ and $p=o(1)$.

egin{thm}\label{thmdense}
For every $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $pn\ge C$
and $p=o(1)$, then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) \sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}}. $$
\end{thm}

One can combine Theorem~ef{thmdense} with~\cite{BCE} to obtain
a single formula which allows for constant~$p$ as well. Indeed, let $b:=1/(1-p)$.
If $p=o(1)$ a series expansion gives $\ln b=-\ln (1-p)=p+O(p^2)$.
Thus
$$
\sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}} = \sqrt{rac{n^2 p}{\ln b\log_b (np)}}
=(1+o(1)){n \over \sqrt{\log_b (np)}}.
$$
Also if~$p$ is constant, then $\log_b n=(1+o(1))\log_b(np)$.
So altogether we obtain the following.
egin{corollary}\label{thmdense1}
For every  $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $C/n \le p \le 1-\eps$,
then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) rac{n}{\sqrt{\log_{b} (np)}}. $$
\end{corollary}

In the last section of the paper, we estimate~ccl$(G_{n,c/n})$ where $c>1$ is fixed.
Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} observed that there are constants~$c_1$ and~$c_2$
such that $c_1\sqrt{n /\log n}\le {m ccl}(G_{n,c/n})\le c_2\sqrt{n}$
and asked what the correct order of magnitude is.
  

--- Model Generation for result #6 ---
\label{thmsubcritical}
Let $\varphi(\beta)$ denote the unique positive root of the equation
$\varphi=\log (1+\varphi / \beta)$.
For every $c>1$ there exists a constant $C=C(c)$ such that
$${
m ccl}(G_{n,c/n})=(1\pm \eps) C\sqrt{n/\varphi(\log(n/c))},
$$
where $\eps=\eps(c)>0$ as~$n$ tends to infinity.
