Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
 entries of $M_n$ satisfy this property, then
the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $\lt(p^{1/r} + o(1)\rt)^n$.
All of the results in this paper hold for any characteristic zero integral
domain replacing the complex numbers.


In the special case where the entries of $M_n$ are  ``fair coin flips''
(taking the values $+1,-1$ each with probability $1/2$), our general bound
implies that the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most
$\lt(\frac{1}{\sqrt2}+o(1)\rt)^n$, improving on the previous best upper bound
of $\lt(\frac{3}{4}+o(1)\rt)^n$, proved by Tao and Vu \cite{TV2}.


In the special case where the entries of $M_n$ are  ``lazy coin flips''
(taking values $+1,-1$ each with probability $1/4$ and value 0 with probability $1/2$), our general bound implies  that
the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most
$\lt(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\rt)^n$, which is asymptotically sharp.

Our method is a refinement of those  from \cite{KKS} and \cite{TV2}. In
particular,  we  make a critical use of the Structure Theorem from
\cite{TV2}, which was obtained using tools from additive combinatorics.

\section {Introduction}\label{s:intro}

Let $n$ be a large integer and $M_n$ be an $n$ by $n$ random matrix whose
entries are independent (but not necessarily identically distributed) discrete
random variables taking values in the complex numbers. The problem of
estimating the probability that $M_{n}$ is singular is a basic problem in the
theory of random matrices and combinatorics.  The goal of this paper is to
give a bound that applies to a large variety of distributions. The general
statement (Theorem~\ref{main theorem}) is a bit technical, so we will first
discuss a few corollaries concerning special cases.


The most famous special  case is when the entries of $M_{n}$ are
independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables
(taking values $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$). The following conjecture has
been open for quite some time:  

--- Model Generation for result #4 ---
[Kahn, Kalai and Linial~\cite{KKS}]\label{KKL}
If the entries of $M_{n}$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, then
\begin{equation}\label{KKL bound}
\P(M_{n} \text{ is singular})\leq C^{n}
\end{equation}
for an absolute constant $C$ strictly less than one.
