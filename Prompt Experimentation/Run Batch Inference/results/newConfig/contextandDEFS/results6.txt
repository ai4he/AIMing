Below is the prompt for result #6:
You are a mathematician specializing in probabilistic combinatorics and the theory of random graphs. Your task is to read the provided mathematical context and generate a plausible, non-trivial theorem or conjecture that logically follows from it. To ensure you understand the specific vocabulary, use the following definitions.

\subsection*{Definitions}
egin{enumerate}
    \item 	extbf{Random Graph $G(n,p)$:} A graph on $n$ labeled vertices where each of the $inom{n}{2}$ possible edges is present independently with probability $p$.
    \item 	extbf{Graph Minor:} A graph $H$ is a \emph{minor} of $G$ if for every vertex $h \in V(H)$ there is a connected subset $B_h \subseteq V(G)$ such that all the $B_h$ are disjoint and $G$ contains an edge between $B_h$ and $B_{h'}$ whenever $hh'$ is an edge of $H$.
    \item 	extbf{Contraction Clique Number, $\mathrm{ccl}(G)$:} The largest integer $k$ such that $K_k$ is a minor of $G$.
    \item 	extbf{Asymptotically Almost Surely (a.a.s.):} An event occurs with probability tending to 1 as the number of vertices $n$ tends to infinity.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Context}
  })=(1 \pm \eps)n/\sqrt{\log_b n}$,
where $b:=1/(1-p)$. Here~$G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on~$n$ vertices
where the edges are present independently and with probability~$p$.
We say that an event occurs \emph{asymptotically almost surely} (a.a.s.)
if it occurs with probability tending to~$1$ as~$n$ tends to infinity.

Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} considered the order of the largest
complete minor in a sparser random graph (and more generally in arbitrary
pseudo-random and expanding graphs).
%They observed that the proof in~\cite{BCE} can be extended to the case
%$p 	o 0$ as long as $p$ is not too small, but that it breaks down eventually.
They determined the order of magnitude of~ccl$(G_{n,p})$
as long as~$p\ge n^{\eps-1}$. Our first result determines~ccl$(G_{n,p})$ asymptotically
as long as $p\ge C/n$ and $p=o(1)$.

egin{thm}\label{thmdense}
For every $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $pn\ge C$
and $p=o(1)$, then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) \sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}}. $$
\end{thm}

One can combine Theorem~ef{thmdense} with~\cite{BCE} to obtain
a single formula which allows for constant~$p$ as well. Indeed, let $b:=1/(1-p)$.
If $p=o(1)$ a series expansion gives $\ln b=-\ln (1-p)=p+O(p^2)$.
Thus
$$
\sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}} = \sqrt{rac{n^2 p}{\ln b\log_b (np)}}
=(1+o(1)){n \over \sqrt{\log_b (np)}}.
$$
Also if~$p$ is constant, then $\log_b n=(1+o(1))\log_b(np)$.
So altogether we obtain the following.
egin{corollary}\label{thmdense1}
For every  $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $C/n \le p \le 1-\eps$,
then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) rac{n}{\sqrt{\log_{b} (np)}}. $$
\end{corollary}

In the last section of the paper, we estimate~ccl$(G_{n,c/n})$ where $c>1$ is fixed.
Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} observed that there are constants~$c_1$ and~$c_2$
such that $c_1\sqrt{n /\log n}\le {m ccl}(G_{n,c/n})\le c_2\sqrt{n}$
and asked what the correct order of magnitude is.
 


Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.
