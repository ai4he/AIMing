Below is the prompt for result #3:
You are a mathematician specializing in 	extbf{probabilistic and extremal combinatorics}, with a focus on random graphs. Your task is to read the provided mathematical context and generate a plausible, non-trivial theorem or conjecture that logically follows from it. To ensure you understand the specific vocabulary, use the following definitions.

\subsection*{Definitions}
egin{enumerate}
    \item 	extbf{Proper k-coloring:} Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices, and let $k$ be an integer dividing $n$.  $G$ is said to be strongly $k$-colorable if for every partition of $V(G)$ into disjoint sets $V_1 \cup \dots \cup V_r$, all of size exactly $k$, there exists a proper vertex $k$-coloring of $G$ with each color appearing exactly once in each $V_i$.
    \item 	extbf{Strongly k-colorable:} In the case when $k$ does not divide $n$, $G$ is defined to be strongly $k$-colorable if the graph obtained by adding $k ig\lceil rac{n}{k} igceil - n$ isolated vertices is strongly $k$-colorable. The strong chromatic number of $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ is strongly $k$-colorable.
    \item 	extbf{Strong Chromatic Number, $\chi_s(G)$:} The minimum integer $k$ for which $G$ is strongly $k$-colorable.
    \item 	extbf{Independent Transversal:} An \emph{independent transversal} with respect to $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^r$ is an independent set in $G$ which contains exactly one vertex from each $V_i$.
    \item 	extbf{Maximum Degree, $\Delta(G)$:} The largest degree of any vertex in the graph $G$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Context}
 (\sigma \frac{\Delta}{\log
  n}\big) = o(\Delta)$ neighbors in $V_j$, since $\sigma \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log
  n}$.  Also, by construction of $I_1$, every part whose index is not in $I_1$ has at most
$\frac{\ep}{4} \Delta$ locally big vertices.  Hence the size of $V'_j$ is at least $|V_j|
-(1+o(1)) \Delta - \frac{\ep}{4} \Delta \geq \frac{\ep}{2} \Delta$, as claimed.

Let us say that a set $U_t$ satisfies property $\mathbf{Q}_t$ if for every $k \not \in
I_1 \cup J_t$, all the vertices in $U_t$ that
are not locally big with respect to $V_k$ have together at most
$300 (\tau - t)\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in $V_k$.
We need the following  analogue of Lemma \ref{lem:first-stage}.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:second-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $U_t$ is an independent transversal on $V'_{J_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{Q}_t$.  Then we can extend $U_t$ to $U_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V'_{J_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_{t-1}$.
\end{lemma}
We also postpone the proof of this lemma until Section \ref{sec:last-lemma}.
Starting with $U_\tau = \emptyset$, we iterate this lemma until we obtain $U_1$, an
independent transversal on $V'_{J_1}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_1$.
Since $\tau \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log n}$, this property implies that each $V_k$
with $k \not \in I_1 \cup J_1$ has $O\big(\tau \frac{\Delta}{\log n}\big) = o(\Delta)$
vertices with neighbors in $U_1$.

Finally, let $K = [r] \setminus (I_1 \cup J_1)$.  Delete all neighbors of $T_1 \cup U_1$
and all locally big vertices from every $V_k$ with $k\in K$, and denote the resulting sets
by $V'_k$. All $V'_k$ will still have size at least $\big(1 + \frac{\ep}{2}\big) \Delta$,
but now no vertex there has more than $\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in any single set $V_k'$.
Thus, the following result from \cite{LS} implies that for sufficiently large $n$, there
is an independent transversal on $V'_K$, which completes $T_1 \cup U_1$ into an
independent transversal through all parts.
  


Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.


--- Model Generation for result #3 ---
\label{thm:main}
  The strong chromatic number is at most $4\big(\frac{\Delta}{\log n}\big)^{2/3} \log
  n$.
