Below is the prompt for result #3:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
(\sigma \frac{\Delta}{\log
  n}\big) = o(\Delta)$ neighbors in $V_j$, since $\sigma \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log
  n}$.  Also, by construction of $I_1$, every part whose index is not in $I_1$ has at most
$\frac{\ep}{4} \Delta$ locally big vertices.  Hence the size of $V'_j$ is at least $|V_j|
-(1+o(1)) \Delta - \frac{\ep}{4} \Delta \geq \frac{\ep}{2} \Delta$, as claimed.

Let us say that a set $U_t$ satisfies property $\mathbf{Q}_t$ if for every $k \not \in
I_1 \cup J_t$, all the vertices in $U_t$ that
are not locally big with respect to $V_k$ have together at most
$300 (\tau - t)\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in $V_k$.
We need the following  analogue of Lemma \ref{lem:first-stage}.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:second-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $U_t$ is an independent transversal on $V'_{J_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{Q}_t$.  Then we can extend $U_t$ to $U_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V'_{J_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_{t-1}$.
\end{lemma}
We also postpone the proof of this lemma until Section \ref{sec:last-lemma}.
Starting with $U_\tau = \emptyset$, we iterate this lemma until we obtain $U_1$, an
independent transversal on $V'_{J_1}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_1$.
Since $\tau \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log n}$, this property implies that each $V_k$
with $k \not \in I_1 \cup J_1$ has $O\big(\tau \frac{\Delta}{\log n}\big) = o(\Delta)$
vertices with neighbors in $U_1$.

Finally, let $K = [r] \setminus (I_1 \cup J_1)$.  Delete all neighbors of $T_1 \cup U_1$
and all locally big vertices from every $V_k$ with $k\in K$, and denote the resulting sets
by $V'_k$. All $V'_k$ will still have size at least $\big(1 + \frac{\ep}{2}\big) \Delta$,
but now no vertex there has more than $\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in any single set $V_k'$.
Thus, the following result from \cite{LS} implies that for sufficiently large $n$, there
is an independent transversal on $V'_K$, which completes $T_1 \cup U_1$ into an
independent transversal through all parts.
  


    
Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #3 ---
\label{thm:new-thm}
  Let $\G$ be a graph of order $n$ where each part of a partition has size $\ge \Delta$,
  and let $\ep > 0$ be a constant.  If $\Delta \ge \frac{n}{(\log n)^{\theta (\ep)}}$ for
  some $\theta(\ep)$ sufficiently large, then $\G$ contains an independent transversal.
