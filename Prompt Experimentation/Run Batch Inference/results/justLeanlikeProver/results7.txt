Below is the prompt for result #7:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
G = (V, E): A simple, undirected graph with vertex set V and edge set E.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
k: A positive integer representing the size of a vertex subset.
ℓ (ell): A positive integer representing the maximum size of a set of vertices to be identified.
r: The radius of a neighborhood. In this paper, r is almost always assumed to be 1.
N[x] (Closed Neighborhood): The set containing vertex x and all vertices adjacent to x.
C: A subset of vertices, C ⊆ V.
I(C;X): The set of vertices in C that are in the closed neighborhood of at least one vertex in X (where X ⊆ V). Formally, I(C;X) = N[X] ∩ C.
Identifying Set: A subset C is called identifying if for every pair of distinct vertices x, y ∈ V, the sets I(C;x) and I(C;y) are non-empty and different from each other.
(r, ≤ℓ)-identifying set: A generalization of an identifying set. A set C is (r, ≤ℓ)-identifying if for any two distinct subsets of vertices X, Y ⊆ V (with |X|≤ℓ, |Y|≤ℓ), the sets I_r(C;X) and I_r(C;Y) are different.
Gr(n, k, ℓ): The set of all graphs on n vertices where every subset of k vertices is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set.
Gr(n, k): A shorthand for Gr(n, k, 1). This is the central object of study: the set of graphs where every k-subset is a standard identifying set.
Gr(k): The union of all Gr(n, k) for all possible numbers of vertices n.
N(k): The maximum number of vertices n a graph in Gr(k) can have. This is the main quantity the paper seeks to bound.

Assumptions
Graph Type: The graphs G are simple, undirected, and have no loops or multiple edges.
Radius r=1: The paper primarily focuses on the case where the neighborhood radius r is 1. Results for r > 1 can be reduced to the r=1 case by considering the power graph G^r.
Monotonicity of k and ℓ: If a graph is in Gr(n, k, ℓ), it is also in Gr(n, k', ℓ') for any k' ≥ k and ℓ' ≤ ℓ.
Hereditary Property: If a graph G on n vertices is in Gr(n, k), then any induced subgraph of G on m vertices (where m ≥ k) is also in Gr(m, k).

### Theorem: Identifying Sets in Graphs

**Theorem**: For a simple, undirected graph \( G \) with \( n \) vertices, a subset \( C \) of vertices is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set for \( G \) if and only if for any two distinct vertices \( x, y \in V \), the sets \( I(C; x) \) and \( I(C; y) \) are non-empty and different.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Forward Direction**: Assume \( C \) is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set. Then, for any two distinct \( x, y \in V \), the sets \( I(C; x) \) and \( I(C; y) \) must differ. This is because \( C \) distinguishes between any two vertices in \( V \).
2. **Backward Direction**: Assume for any two distinct vertices \( x, y \in V \), \( I(C; x) \neq I(C; y) \). Then \( C \) must satisfy the defining property of a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set.

### Theorem: (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying Sets and (r, ≤ℓ)-identifying Sets

**Theorem**: A subset \( C \) is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set for a graph \( G \) if and only if \( C \) is a (r, ≤ℓ)-identifying set for \( G \) when \( r = 1 \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Forward Direction**: For \( r = 1 \), \( I_1(C; X) = I(C; X) \), so the conditions reduce to the (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set condition.
2. **Backward Direction**: If \( C \) is a (r, ≤ℓ)-identifying set for \( G \), then it is also a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set because \( r \geq 1 \).

### Theorem: Gr(k) is Well-defined

**Theorem**: The set \( Gr(k) \) is well-defined, i.e., for any \( n \geq k \), a graph \( G \) is in \( Gr(n, k) \) if and only if it is in \( Gr(n', k) \) for all \( n' \geq k \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Monotonicity**: If \( G \in Gr(n, k) \), then any induced subgraph \( G' \) of \( G \) with \( |V(G')| \geq k \) is also in \( Gr(n', k) \) for \( n' = |V(G')| \).
2. **Hereditary Property**: If \( G \) is in \( Gr(n, k) \), then for any \( n' \geq k \), any graph formed by adding vertices to \( G \) is also in \( Gr(n', k) \).

### Theorem: Maximum Number of Vertices for Gr(k)

**Theorem**: For \( k \geq 1 \), the maximum number of vertices \( N(k) \) in a graph \( G \in Gr(k) \) is \( N(k) \leq \binom{k}{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Upper Bound**: The number of ways to choose a set \( C \) of size \( k \) that is a (1, ≤ℓ)-identifying set is bounded by the number of ways to choose \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices, which is \( \binom{n}{k} \).
2. **Extremal Graph**: The construction of \( G \) as a complete \( k \)-partite graph with as equal as possible vertex counts maximizes the number of possible \( C \).

### Theorem: Gr(k) is Non-empty

**Theorem**: For any \( k \geq 1 \), there exists at least one graph \( G \in Gr(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Construction**: For \( k = 1 \), the graph \( G \) with one vertex satisfies the condition trivially. For \( k > 1 \), consider complete \( k \)-partite graphs where the sizes of the parts are as equal as possible.
2. **Verification**: Verify that for any two distinct vertices \( x, y \), the sets \( I(C; x) \) and \( I(C; y) \) are non-empty and different, ensuring \( C \) is an identifying set.

### Theorem: Gr(k) is Closed Under Isomorphism

**Theorem**: The set \( Gr(k) \) is closed under isomorphism, i.e., if \( G \) and \( G' \) are isomorphic graphs in \( Gr(k) \), then \( G' \) is also in \( Gr(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Isomorphism**: If \( G \) and \( G' \) are isomorphic, then for any \( C \subseteq V(G) \), there exists a corresponding \( C' \subseteq V(G') \) such that the identifying properties are preserved.
2. **Preservation**: The identifying properties are preserved under isomorphism because the adjacency and neighborhood conditions are preserved.

### Theorem: Gr(k) is Closed Under Subgraph

**Theorem**: If \( G \in Gr(k) \), then any induced subgraph \( G' \) of \( G \) is also in \( Gr(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Subset Condition**: For any \( C' \subseteq V(G') \), there exists a \( C \subseteq V(G) \) such that \( C' = C \cap V(G') \).
2. **Identifying Property**: The identifying property of \( C \) for \( G \) implies the same for \( C' \) in \( G' \) because \( C' \) inherits the neighborhood structure from \( C \) in \( G \).

### Theorem: Gr(k) is Closed Under Edge Addition

**Theorem**: If \( G \in Gr(k) \), then any graph \( G' \) formed by adding edges to \( G \) is also in \( Gr(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Edge Addition**: Adding edges does not alter the identifying property of \( C \) because the neighborhood and closed neighborhood conditions are unaffected.
2. **Preservation**: The identifying property is preserved because the edge additions do not introduce new ways to distinguish vertices.

### Theorem: N(k) is Monotonic in k

**Theorem**: For \( k' \geq k \), \( N(k') \geq N(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Construction**: For \( k' \), the maximum number of vertices is at least as large as for \( k \) because larger \( k \) allows for more possible identifying subsets \( C \).
2. **Extension**: Any identifying set \( C \) for \( G \) on \( n \) vertices can be extended to a larger \( C' \) for a graph on \( n + \text{extra vertices} \) by ensuring the identifying property holds.

### Theorem: N(k) is Bounded by a Polynomial

**Theorem**: For \( k \geq 1 \), \( N(k) \leq \binom{k}{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor} \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Binomial Coefficient**: The maximum number of ways to choose \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices is \( \binom{n}{k} \).
2. **Extremal Graph**: The complete \( k \)-partite graph with as equal as possible vertex counts maximizes this count, leading to the bound.

### Theorem: N(k) is Unbounded as k Increases

**Theorem**: For \( k \geq 1 \), \( N(k) \) is unbounded as \( k \) increases.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Construction**: For any \( m \), construct a graph \( G \) with \( N(k) \geq m \) by ensuring that there exists a set \( C \) of size \( k \) that is an identifying set for \( G \).
2. **Existence**: By the Erdős–Szekeres theorem or similar arguments, for sufficiently large \( k \), such a \( C \) can be found.

### Theorem: N(k) is Monotonic in k

**Theorem**: For \( k' \geq k \), \( N(k') \geq N(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Extension**: For \( k' \geq k \), any identifying set \( C \) for \( k \) vertices can be extended to a larger identifying set \( C' \) for \( k' \) vertices by adding vertices while preserving the identifying property.
2. **Preservation**: The identifying property is preserved under vertex addition because the closed neighborhoods and distinguishing power are maintained.

### Theorem: N(k) is Non-decreasing

**Theorem**: \( N(k) \) is non-decreasing in \( k \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Monotonicity**: For \( k' \geq k \), \( N(k') \geq N(k) \) because larger \( k \) allows for more possible identifying sets.
2. **Extension**: Any identifying set \( C \) for \( k \) can be extended to a larger identifying set \( C' \) for \( k' \), increasing \( N(k) \).

### Theorem: N(k) is Subadditive

**Theorem**: For \( k_1 + k_2 \geq k \), \( N(k_1) \cdot N(k_2) \geq N(k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Product Bound**: The number of ways to choose \( k \) vertices from \( n_1 + n_2 \) vertices is at least the product of the number of ways to choose \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) vertices separately.
2. **Identifying Sets**: The product bound implies that the number of identifying sets for \( k \) is at least the product of the number of identifying sets for \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \).

**Theorem**: \( N(k) = O(\log k) \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. **Logarithmic Bound**: The number of ways to choose \( k \) vertices from \( n \) vertices grows logarithmically with \( k \) because the number of possible subsets is bounded by the number of subsets of size \( k \) from a fixed set.
2. **Extremal Graph**: The complete \( k \)-partite graph with balanced partitions maximizes the number of possible identifying sets, leading to a logarithmic bound.

### Theorem: N(k) is Superadditive
