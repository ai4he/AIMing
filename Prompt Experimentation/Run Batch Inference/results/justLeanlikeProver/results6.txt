Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any pair of vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
ccl(G): A function that returns the order (i.e., the number of vertices) of the largest complete minor in graph G.
b: A parameter defined as b := 1/(1-p).
ε (epsilon): An arbitrarily small positive constant used to frame the precision of the result (e.g., in (1 ± ε)).
C: A constant, whose value depends on ε, that defines the lower bound for the average degree (np) in the main theorem.
c: A fixed constant greater than 1, used to define the edge probability in the sparse case (p = c/n).
δ (delta): A constant, whose value depends on the constant c.

Assumptions
The results are presented as theorems that hold under specific constraints on the parameters. The key assumptions are the conditions stated in the "if" part of the theorems.
Asymptotic Analysis: All results are for the limit where n (the number of vertices) tends to infinity. The conclusions hold "asymptotically almost surely" (a.a.s.), meaning with a probability that approaches 1 as n grows.
Conditions on Edge Probability p:
For Corollary 1.3, it is assumed that the edge probability p is in the range C/n ≤ p ≤ 1-ε. This means the average degree (np) is at least some large constant C, and p is bounded away from 1.
For Theorem 1.4, it is assumed that the edge probability p is exactly p = c/n, where c is a fixed constant greater than 1.

### Theorem: On the Order of the Largest Complete Minor in Sparse Random Graphs

**Theorem:**  
Consider a random graph \( G \) with \( n \) vertices and edge probability \( p = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c > 1 \) is a fixed constant. Then, the order \( ccl(G) \) of the largest complete minor in \( G \) satisfies the following almost-sure property as \( n \to \infty \):
\[ ccl(G) = \Theta\left(\frac{n}{p}\right) = \Theta(n) \]

**Proof Sketch:**  
The proof leverages the asymptotic behavior of sparse random graphs and the properties of their complete minors. The key steps are:
1. **Upper bound \( ccl(G) \leq \frac{n}{p} + \text{o}(n) \):**  
   Use the fact that the largest complete minor cannot have more vertices than the number of vertices in a maximal complete subgraph. The probability that a given vertex is part of a large complete subgraph goes to 0 as \( p = \frac{c}{n} \) is fixed, and the number of vertices is \( n \).

2. **Lower bound \( ccl(G) \geq \frac{n}{2p} + \text{o}(n) \):**  
   Use the fact that the number of edges in a sparse random graph is concentrated around its expectation \( np \), and the existence of a large complete minor can be argued via the expected number of complete minors of a certain size.

Combining these gives \( ccl(G) = \Theta(n) \), as \( p = \frac{c}{n} \).

### Additional Notes:
- The theorem assumes \( p = \frac{c}{n} \) for some fixed \( c > 1 \). This is the sparse regime where \( np \to \infty \), but \( p \to 0 \).
- The theorem provides a tight asymptotic estimate for \( ccl(G) \), which is consistent with known results in random graph theory on the size of the largest complete subgraph.
- The proof leverages probabilistic methods to derive the almost-sure behavior of \( ccl(G) \).

### Lean4 Formalization Sketch
```lean4
theorem largest_complete_minor_order_sparse (c : ℝ) (hc : c > 1) :
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, 
  Pr[ccl(G n p) = Θ(n)] ≥ 1 - ε :=
```

### Explanation:
1. The theorem states that for any fixed \( c > 1 \), the order of the largest complete minor \( ccl(G) \) in a sparse random graph \( G \) (with \( p = \frac{c}{n} \)) is \( \Theta(n) \) asymptotically almost surely.
2. The Lean4 formalization captures the asymptotic behavior using the probabilistic measure \( Pr \).
3. The proof would involve detailed probabilistic analysis, leveraging concentration of measure and the properties of random graphs.
