Below is the prompt for result #1:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
N = (V, A, r, X): An X-network, which is a rooted, acyclic directed graph (digraph). V is the set of vertices, A is the set of arcs (directed edges), r is the root vertex, and X is the set of leaves, typically representing species or taxa.
Arc: An ordered pair of vertices (u, v), representing a directed connection from u to v.
CSD map (Connected Surjective Digraph map): A function ϕ: N → N' between two networks that maps vertices to vertices. It must be surjective (onto) and preserve connectivity in a specific way: the inverse image of any vertex in N' must be a connected set of vertices in N.
Restricted Set: A non-empty set of vertices B that represents a "bottleneck". Formally, there is at most one vertex w' outside of B that has an arc pointing into B. If such a w' exists, it is called the anchor of B.
R(v): The smallest restricted set containing a given vertex v. This is constructed by a specific algorithm provided in the paper.
Restricted CSD map: A CSD map ϕ: N → N' where the inverse image of every vertex in N' is a restricted set in N.
ResTr(N) (Restricted Tree of N): The main object constructed by the paper. It is a well-defined tree derived from a network N by partitioning N's vertices into the sets R(v) and forming a quotient graph. It serves as a canonical simplification of N.

Assumptions
Network Structure: The networks N are assumed to be rooted, acyclic, and finite directed graphs. All vertices are assumed to be ancestral to at least one leaf.
Bottleneck Definition: The core concept of a "restricted set" formalizes the intuitive notion of a bottleneck in the network's information or evolutionary flow. A set has restricted entry if there's only one "way in" from the outside.
Existence of an Algorithm: The paper assumes the existence and well-definedness of an algorithm that, for any vertex v, computes the smallest restricted set R(v) containing it.
Universal Property: The constructed tree ResTr(N) is claimed to have a "universal" property, meaning any other simplification of N via a restricted CSD map must factor through ResTr(N). This makes ResTr(N) a canonical or fundamental simplification.




--- Model Generation for result #1 ---
### Theorem:
**Theorem**: If \( N \) is an \( X \)-network and \( \phi: N \to N' \) is a restricted CSD map, then the image \( \phi(X) \) under \( \phi \) of the set of leaves \( X \) in \( N \) is a set of leaves in \( N' \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Since \( \phi \) is a CSD map, it is surjective. Thus, for every \( x' \in X' \), there exists a \( x \in X \) such that \( \phi(x) = x' \). Hence, \( \phi(X) \subseteq X' \).
2. To show \( \phi(X) \) is a set of leaves in \( N' \), we use the properties of \( \phi \) being a restricted CSD map. For each \( x' \in \phi(X) \), there exists \( x \in X \) such that \( \phi(x) = x' \). Since \( x \) is a leaf in \( N \), the vertex \( x' \) in \( N' \) must be a leaf because the map \( \phi \) preserves the leaf structure.

### Additional Theorem (for the purpose of this exercise):
**Theorem**: If \( \phi: N \to N' \) is a restricted CSD map, then for every \( v' \in V' \), the vertex \( v' \) has in-degree 0 or 1 in \( N' \).

**Proof Sketch**:
1. By the definition of a restricted CSD map, for every \( v' \in V' \), the inverse image \( \phi^{-1}(v') \) is a restricted set in \( N \).
2. In a restricted set, there can be at most one vertex \( w \) such that \( w \) has an arc pointing into \( B \), where \( B \) is the restricted set.
3. This implies that \( v' \) in \( N' \) can have at most one incoming arc, making its in-degree at most 1.
4. Additionally, if \( \phi^{-1}(v') \) is empty, \( v' \) has in-degree 0.

### Final Theorem (for the purpose of this exercise):
**Theorem**: The restricted tree \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is a tree.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. \( N \) is a rooted and acyclic digraph.
2. \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is constructed by partitioning the vertices of \( N \) into the sets \( R(v) \) and forming a quotient graph, which inherits the tree structure from the original network \( N \).
3. Since \( N \) is acyclic, the quotient graph \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is also acyclic.
4. Additionally, \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is a tree because it is a connected acyclic graph.

### Abstract Plan:
1. **Leaf Preservation**: Show that \( \phi(X) \) is a subset of \( X' \).
   - \( \phi \) is surjective, so every element in \( X' \) has a preimage in \( X \).
2. **Leaf Property**: Show that \( \phi(X) \) is a set of leaves in \( N' \).
   - For each \( x' \in \phi(X) \), its preimage \( x \in X \) is a leaf, and \( \phi \) preserves the leaf structure.
3. **Degree Condition**: Show that every vertex in \( N' \) has in-degree 0 or 1.
   - For every \( v' \), its preimage is a restricted set, which limits the number of incoming arcs.
4. **Tree Structure**: Show that \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is a tree.
   - \( N \) is a tree-like structure, and \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) inherits this property after partitioning.
