Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
n: A large integer representing the dimension of the matrices.
M_n: An n x n complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables. This is the main object of study.
Singular Matrix: A square matrix whose determinant is zero. The probability of this event is the central quantity to be bounded.
p: A constant between 0 and 1, representing an upper bound on the probability that a random variable takes any single value.
r: A constant positive integer, used as an exponent in the main property definition.
p-bounded of exponent r: A key technical property defined for the distribution of the random entries of the matrix M_n. A random variable ξ is p-bounded of exponent r if there is no value z_0 such that P(ξ = z_0) > p, and for any r distinct values z_1, ..., z_r, the probability P(ξ ∈ {z_1, ..., z_r}) is bounded away from 1 by a constant.
Integral Domain of Characteristic Zero: An algebraic structure (like the integers or complex numbers) where the main results hold.

Assumptions
Large n: The results are asymptotic, holding as n (the matrix dimension) tends to infinity.
Independent Entries: The entries of the random matrix M_n are assumed to be mutually independent random variables. They are not required to be identically distributed.
Discrete Distribution: The random entries of M_n take values from a discrete set of complex numbers.
p-bounded Property: The main theorem assumes that the distributions of the matrix entries satisfy the p-bounded of exponent r property for some constants p and r. This property ensures that the random variables are "not too concentrated" on any single value or on any small set of values.

### Theorem for the Mathematical Paper

**Theorem Statement**:  
Let \( M_n \) be an \( n \times n \) complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables with values in a countable set \( \Omega \). Suppose that for each entry \( M_{i,j} \) of \( M_n \), the probability \( P(M_{i,j} = z) \) is \( p \)-bounded of exponent \( r \) for some constants \( p \) and \( r \), where \( 0 < p < 1 \) and \( r \geq 1 \). Then, the probability that \( M_n \) is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) is bounded above by a constant depending only on \( p \), \( r \), and \( \Omega \), and is independent of \( n \).

### Explanation

1. **Key Components**:
   - \( M_n \) is an \( n \times n \) matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables.
   - Each entry \( M_{i,j} \) has a discrete probability distribution with the \( p \)-bounded of exponent \( r \) property.
   - The goal is to bound the probability that \( M_n \) is singular.

2. **Intuition**:
   - The \( p \)-bounded property ensures that no single entry can take a value with probability significantly greater than \( p \), and the probability of any small set of values is not concentrated. This prevents any single entry from dominating the determinant's behavior.
   - The independence of entries allows us to use the union bound or other probabilistic methods to bound the probability of the matrix being singular.

3. **Proof Sketch**:
   - The determinant of \( M_n \) is a sum of products of entries. The independence and \( p \)-boundedness prevent any single term from dominating the sum.
   - The probability that the determinant is zero is bounded by the probability that any minor (submatrix) has a zero determinant, which is bounded by the probability that any submatrix has a zero entry.
   - The submatrix entries are independent and \( p \)-bounded, so the probability of any submatrix being singular is small.

4. **Formalization**:
   - The formalized theorem uses the \( p \)-bounded property to bound the probability of each entry taking a specific value, and then uses independence to bound the probability that the determinant is zero.

5. **Generalization**:
   - The theorem applies to matrices where the entries are discrete random variables with the \( p \)-bounded property, and the entries need not be identically distributed.

### Additional Notes

- The \( p \)-bounded property is a form of "bounded irregularity" in the distribution of the random variables.
- The independence of entries is critical for bounding the probability of the matrix being singular.
- The theorem generalizes existing results in random matrix theory where the entries are identically distributed with bounded support.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Define the \( p \)-bounded property for the entries**:
   - For each entry \( M_{i,j} \), no single value \( z \) has probability \( > p \), and the probability of any \( r \) distinct values is not too large.

2. **Express the probability of the matrix being singular**:
   - The determinant is zero iff the matrix has a zero minor.
   - Bound the probability that any minor has a zero determinant using the \( p \)-bounded property.

3. **Use independence to combine the bounds**:
   - For independent entries, the probability of the matrix being singular is the sum of probabilities over all minors.
   - Each term is bounded, so the sum is bounded.

4. **Conclude the result**:
   - The probability is bounded by a constant independent of \( n \).

### Notes on Lean4 Formalization

- `p_bounded` is a hypothetical predicate representing the \( p \)-bounded property.
- `Independent M i j` is a hypothetical predicate representing the independence of entries \( M_{i,j} \) and \( M_{k,l} \) when \( (i,j) \neq (k,l) \).
- `P (det M = 0)` is the probability that the determinant is zero.
- The theorem assumes independence and \( p \)-boundedness for all entries, and concludes a bound on the probability of singularity.

### Final Answer

The theorem formalizes the mathematical result that for an \( n \times n \) matrix with independent discrete entries satisfying a \( p \)-bounded property, the probability that the matrix is singular is bounded above by a constant independent of \( n \). The proof leverages independence and the irregularity of the entries to control the probability of the determinant being zero.
