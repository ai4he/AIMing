Below is the prompt for result #5:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
G: A general graph.
K_n: A complete graph with n vertices (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). This is the primary object of study.
r: The number of colors used in an edge-coloring of a graph.
n: The number of vertices in the complete graph K_n.
Heterochromatic Tree: A tree where every edge has a different color. A single vertex is also considered a heterochromatic tree.
ϕ (phi): A specific r-edge-coloring of a graph G, which is a function that assigns one of r colors to each edge.
t_r(G) (Heterochromatic Tree Partition Number): The central parameter of study. It is the minimum integer p such that for any r-edge-coloring of the graph G, its vertices can be covered by at most p vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees.
t: An integer derived from r.
f(r): A function that maps the number of colors r to the integer t, defined by the inequality t(t-1)/2 + 2 ≤ r ≤ (t+1)t/2 + 1.

Assumptions
Scope of r: The number of colors r is assumed to be in the range 2 ≤ r ≤ n(n-1)/2. The case r=1 is considered trivial. n(n-1)/2 is the total number of edges in K_n.
Coloring Requirement: An r-edge-coloring means that each of the r colors is used at least once on some edge of the graph.
Worst-Case Scenario: The value of t_r(G) is determined by the "worst-case" coloring. It is the maximum number of partitions required over all possible r-edge-colorings of the graph G.
 




--- Model Generation for result #5 ---
### Theorem:
**For a complete graph \( K_n \) with \( n \) vertices and an integer \( r \) such that \( r \) satisfies the inequality \( t(t-1)/2 + 2 \leq r \leq (t+1)t/2 + 1 \) for some integer \( t \), the heterochromatic tree partition number \( t_r(K_n) \) is equal to \( r \).**

### Proof:
1. **Upper Bound (\( t_r(K_n) \leq r \)):**
   - For any \( r \)-edge-coloring of \( K_n \), the number of vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees needed to cover all vertices is at most \( r \). This is because each tree can have at most one edge per color, and there are \( r \) colors.
   - Thus, the total number of trees needed cannot exceed \( r \).

2. **Lower Bound (\( t_r(K_n) \geq r \)):**
   - Construct a specific \( r \)-edge-coloring of \( K_n \) where each color is used exactly once. This is possible because \( r \) satisfies the given inequality.
   - For this coloring, the number of vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees required to cover all \( n \) vertices is exactly \( r \). This is because each color represents a separate tree, and the trees are vertex-disjoint.
   - Since this is the worst-case scenario, \( t_r(K_n) \geq r \).

### Conclusion:
The heterochromatic tree partition number \( t_r(K_n) \) is exactly \( r \).

### Notes:
- The theorem is grounded in the extremal behavior of edge-colorings in complete graphs.
- The conditions on \( r \) ensure that the coloring can be structured to achieve the exact number of trees \( r \).
- The proof leverages the fact that the maximum number of disjoint trees in a complete graph under a given coloring is determined by the number of available colors.
