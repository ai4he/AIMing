Below is the prompt for result #3:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any two vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}. This probability can be a function of n.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
Δ (Delta): The maximum degree (the largest number of edges connected to a single vertex) of the graph G_{n,p}.
V_1, ..., V_r: A collection of disjoint subsets of the vertices of G. In the context of strong colorability, this is a partition of all vertices.
k: A positive integer, typically representing the required number of colors and the size of each set V_i in a partition.
r: The number of disjoint sets (or "parts") in a partition of the vertices.
Independent Transversal: An independent set (a set of vertices with no edges between them) that contains exactly one vertex from each of the sets V_1, ..., V_r.
Strongly k-colorable: A property of a graph G. G is strongly k-colorable if for every partition of its vertices into r sets V_1, ..., V_r of size k, one can find a proper k-coloring where each color appears exactly once in each set V_i. (A small technical adjustment is made if k does not divide n).
sχ(G) (Strong Chromatic Number): The central parameter of study. It is the minimum integer k for which the graph G is strongly k-colorable.
θ (theta): An arbitrary small positive constant used to bound p away from 1.
ε (epsilon): An arbitrary small positive constant used to describe asymptotic bounds (e.g., (1+o(1))Δ).


Assumptions 
The results hold "almost surely" (a.s.), meaning the probability of the statement being true approaches 1 as the number of vertices n tends to infinity.
General Condition: For Theorem 1.1, it is assumed that the edge probability p is bounded away from 1, i.e., p < 1-θ for some constant θ > 0.
Conditions on Edge Probability p for the Strong Chromatic Number:
Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(i)): It is assumed that p is significantly larger than (log⁴n / n)¹/³. The notation used is p ≫ (log⁴n / n)¹/³.
Moderately Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(ii)): It is assumed that p is significantly larger than (log n / n)¹/². The notation used is p ≫ (log n / n)¹/².
Conditions for the Existence of an Independent Transversal (Theorem 1.2):
Sparse Case: It is assumed that the edge probability p is at least (log⁴n) / n, i.e., p ≥ (log⁴n) / n.
Part Size: It is assumed that the vertex set is partitioned into disjoint subsets V_i where the size of each part is at least (1+o(1))Δ. 




--- Model Generation for result #3 ---
### Theorem
In a random graph \( G_{n,p} \) where \( p \) is bounded away from 1, the strong chromatic number \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \) is \( \Theta(\log n) \) under certain conditions on \( p \).

#### Proof Sketch
1. **Setup**: We consider \( G_{n,p} \) with \( p \) bounded away from 1. The strong chromatic number \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \) is the smallest \( k \) such that every partition of the vertices into \( r \) parts of size \( k \) admits a proper \( k \)-coloring where each color class is independent.
2. **Key Conditions**:
   - For Theorem 1.1(i), \( p \gg (\log^4 n / n)^{1/3} \).
   - For Theorem 1.1(ii), \( p \gg (\log n / n)^{1/2} \).
3. **Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(i))**:
   - Show that \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \leq \log n \) by using the probabilistic method.
   - Show that \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \geq \log n \) by carefully analyzing the partition structure and edge probability.
4. **Moderately Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(ii))**:
   - Similar to the dense case, bound \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \) from above and below by \( \log n \).
5. **Conclusion**: The strong chromatic number is \( \Theta(\log n) \) under the given conditions on \( p \).

### Formal Theorem
\boxed{
\begin{theorem}
For a random graph \( G_{n,p} \) with edge probability \( p \) bounded away from 1, if \( p \gg (\log^4 n / n)^{1/3} \) (for the dense case) or \( p \gg (\log n / n)^{1/2} \) (for the moderately dense case), then the strong chromatic number \( s\chi(G_{n,p}) \) is \( \Theta(\log n) \).
\end{theorem}
