### Abstract

A heterochromatic tree is an edge-colored tree in which any two edges have different colors. The heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum positive integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$ are colored with $r$ colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$ vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. In this paper we determine the heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph. 


### Theorem

We will determine the heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $K_n$ denote the complete graph with $n$ vertices. Then
\label{t}
    t_{r}(K_n)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil.
\end{theorem}

### Proof

\begin{proof}
Let $K_n$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices. We will prove that the heterochromatic tree partition number of $K_n$ equals $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will first show that $t_{r}(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. Indeed, if we color the edges of $K_n$ with $r$ colors, then there is an edge $e$ such that $e$ is contained in at most $r-1$ heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_{r-1}$, and the remaining edges form a complete graph $K_{n-1}$. If we color the edges of $K_{n-1}$ with $r$ colors, then by \eqref{cutedge}, we have that ${n-1}\choose 2}\leq {n-1}\choose 2}+1$. Thus $t_r(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will now show that $t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. Let $T_1, \dots, T_p$ be a covering of the complete graph $K_n$ with heterochromatic trees. We will color the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ with $r$ colors as follows. For each edge $e\in E(K_n)$, color $e$ with the color $c(e)$ of the heterochromatic tree $T_i$, in which the edge $e$ is contained. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ are vertex-disjoint, the edge $e$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $c(e)\leq r$, and the coloring is $r$-edge-colored. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ cover $K_n$, every vertex of $K_n$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $p=t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

Combining the above, we have that $t_r(K_n)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, and the proof is complete.

### Abstract

A heterochromatic tree is an edge-colored tree in which any two edges have different colors. The heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum positive integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$ are colored with $r$ colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$ vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. In this paper we determine the heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph. 


### Theorem

We will determine the heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $K_n$ denote the complete graph with $n$ vertices. Then
\label{t}
    t_{r}(K_n)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil.
\end{theorem}

### Proof

\begin{proof}
Let $K_n$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices. We will prove that the heterochromatic tree partition number of $K_n$ equals $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will first show that $t_{r}(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. Indeed, if we color the edges of $K_n$ with $r$ colors, then there is an edge $e$ such that $e$ is contained in at most $r-1$ heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_{r-1}$, and the remaining edges form a complete graph $K_{n-1}$. If we color the edges of $K_{n-1}$ with $r$ colors, then by \eqref{cutedge}, we have that ${n-1}\choose 2}\leq {n-1}\choose 2}+1$. Thus $t_r(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will now show that $t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. Let $T_1, \dots, T_p$ be a covering of the complete graph $K_n$ with heterochromatic trees. We will color the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ with $r$ colors as follows. For each edge $e\in E(K_n)$, color $e$ with the color $c(e)$ of the heterochromatic tree $T_i$, in which the edge $e$ is contained. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ are vertex-disjoint, the edge $e$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $c(e)\leq r$, and the coloring is $r$-edge-colored. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ cover $K_n$, every vertex of $K_n$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $p=t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

Combining the above, we have that $t_r(K_n)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, and the proof is complete.

A heterochromatic tree is an edge-colored tree in which any two edges have different colors. The heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum positive integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$ are colored with $r$ colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$ vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees.

Let $K_n$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices. We will prove that the heterochromatic tree partition number of $K_n$ equals $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will first show that $t_{r}(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$.

If we color the edges of $K_{n-1}$ with $r$ colors, then by \eqref{cutedge}, we have that ${n-1}\choose 2}\leq {n-1}\choose 2}+1$. Thus $t_r(K_n)\geq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

We will now show that $t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. Let $T_1, \dots, T_p$ be a covering of the complete graph $K_n$ with heterochromatic trees. We will color the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ with $r$ colors as follows. For each edge $e\in E(K_n)$, color $e$ with the color $c(e)$ of the heterochromatic tree $T_i$, in which the edge $e$ is contained. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ are vertex-disjoint, the edge $e$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $c(e)\leq r$, and the coloring is $r$-edge-colored. Since the heterochromatic trees $T_1, \dots, T_p$ cover $K_n$, every vertex of $K_n$ is contained in at most $p$ heterochromatic trees. Thus $p=t_r(K_n)\leq \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$. 

Combining the above, we have that $t_r(K_n)=\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, and the proof is complete.
