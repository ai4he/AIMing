Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let ccl(G) denote the order of the largest complete minor in a graph G (also
called the contraction clique number) and let G(n,p) denote a random graph on n
vertices with edge probability p. Bollobas, Catlin and Erdos asymptotically
determined ccl(G (n,p)) when p is a constant. Luczak, Pittel and Wierman gave
bounds on ccl(G(n,p)) when p is very close to 1/n, i.e. inside the phase
transition. Extending the results of Bollobas, Catlin and Erdos, we determine
ccl(G(n,p)) quite tightly, for p>C/n where C is a large constant. If p=C/n, for
an arbitrary constant C>1, then we show that asymptotically almost surely ccl(G
(n,p)) is of order square-root of n. This answers a question of Krivelevich and
Sudakov. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:
 \begin{theorem}[Bollobás, Catlin, Erdős, 1980]
\label{thm:bce_hadwiger}
For almost every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, the contraction clique number, denoted as $ccl(G)$, satisfies:
\[
(1-\epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_2 n}} \le ccl(G) \le (1+\epsilon) \frac{n}{\sqrt{\log_2 n}}
\]
for any $\epsilon > 0$ as $n \to \infty$.
\end{theorem}
