Below is the prompt for result #1:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Suppose N is a phylogenetic network indicating a complicated relationship
among individuals and taxa. Often of interest is a much simpler network, for
example, a species tree T, that summarizes the most fundamental relationships.
The meaning of a species tree is made more complicated by the recent discovery
of the importance of hybridizations and lateral gene transfers. Hence it is
desirable to describe uniform well-defined procedures that yield a tree given a
network N. A useful tool toward this end is a connected surjective digraph
(CSD) map f from N to N' where N' is generally a much simpler network than N. A
set W of vertices in N is "restricted" if there is at most one vertex from
which there is an arc into W, thus yielding a bottleneck in N. A CSD map f from
N to N' is "restricted" if the inverse image of each vertex in N' is restricted
in N. This paper describes a uniform procedure that, given a network N, yields
a well-defined tree called the "restricted tree" of N. There is a restricted
CSD map from N to the restricted tree. Many relationships in the tree can be
proved to appear also in N.

%3.1
A restricted set $B$ is closed.



%Lemma 3.2.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  Suppose $B$ is restricted and $r \notin B$.  For every $b \in B$ there is a directed path from $Anc(B)$ to $b$ such that all vertices on the path except $Anc(B)$ itself lie in $B$.


%3.4
Suppose $B$ and $C$ are restricted sets and there is an arc $(b,c)$ with $b \in B$ and $c \in C$.  Then $B \cup C$ is restricted.

### 3.1. Formalization of the Problem

    The first step in this paper is to formalize the problem of deriving a tree from a network $N$ which summarizes the most fundamental relationships.

    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{phylogenetic network} is a finite, directed acyclic graph
        $N=(V,A,r,X)$ with $V$ the set of vertices, $A$ the set of arcs, $r \in
        V$ the root, and $X$ the set of leaves.
        We label the leaves with taxa $x_1,...,x_k$ and assume that no taxa is
        repeated.  We call $r$ the root, $X$ the set of leaves, and an arc
        $(u,v)$ a \textbf{bud} if $v \in X$.  A pair of vertices $u,v$ are
        \textbf{adjacent} if $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$ is an arc.  We call a pair of
        vertices $u,v$ \textbf{adjacent} if $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$ is an arc.  We
        call a leaf $u$ a \textbf{source} if there is no other leaf $v \neq u$
        which is adjacent to $u$.  We assume that every leaf is a source.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{phylogenetic tree} is a finite, directed acyclic graph
        $T=(V,A,r,X)$ with $V$ the set of vertices, $A$ the set of arcs, $r \in
        V$ the root, and $X$ the set of leaves.
        We label the leaves with taxa $x_1,...,x_k$ and assume that no taxa is
        repeated.  We call $r$ the root, $X$ the set of leaves, and an arc
        $(u,v)$ a \textbf{bud} if $v \in X$.
    \end{definition}

    A phylogenetic tree is a special case of a phylogenetic network with no
    buds.  We want to know how to construct a phylogenetic tree from a
    phylogenetic network.

    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{phylogenetic tree} is a finite, directed acyclic graph
        $T=(V,A,r,X)$ with $V$ the set of vertices, $A$ the set of arcs, $r \in
        V$ the root, and $X$ the set of leaves.
        We label the leaves with taxa $x_1,...,x_k$ and assume that no taxa is
        repeated.  We call $r$ the root, $X$ the set of leaves, and an arc
        $(u,v)$ a \textbf{bud} if $v \in X$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{phylogenetic tree} is a phylogenetic network with no buds.
    \end{definition}

%3.2. 
    Theorem 3.3 (Conjecture)
    Every phylogenetic network has a phylogenetic tree that contains it.

    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

%3.1
A restricted set $B$ is closed.



%Lemma 3.2.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  Suppose $B$ is restricted and $r \notin B$.  For every $b \in B$ there is a directed path from $Anc(B)$ to $b$ such that all vertices on the path except $Anc(B)$ itself lie in $B$.


%3.4
Suppose $B$ and $C$ are restricted sets and there is an arc $(b,c)$ with $b \in B$ and $c \in C$.  Then $B \cup C$ is restricted.
%If $r \notin B$ then  $Anc(B \cup C) = Anc(B)$.
