Below is the prompt for result #2:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
Set Partition of [n]: A collection of disjoint, non-empty subsets (called "blocks") whose union is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
Arc: In the visual representation of a set partition, an arc connects two consecutive elements within the same block.
[n]: The set of integers {1, 2, ..., n}.
[±n]: The set of integers {1, 2, ..., n, -1, -2, ..., -n}.
Set Partition of Type A_n: A standard set partition of [n].
Set Partition of Type B_n or C_n: A set partition of [±n] that is symmetric (if a block B is present, then -B is also present) and has at most one "zero block" (a block B_0 for which B_0 = -B_0).
Set Partition of Type D_n: A set partition of type B_n where the zero block, if it exists, is not a simple pair {i, -i}.
Crossing: A pair of arcs (i, j) and (i', j') such that i < i' < j < j'.
Nesting: A pair of arcs (i, j) and (i', j') such that i < i' < j' < j.
Non-crossing/Non-nesting Partition: A partition with zero crossings or zero nestings, respectively.
Maximal Crossing/Nesting: A set of the largest possible size of arcs that are all mutually crossing or mutually nesting.
Openers op(B): The set of all non-maximal elements in the blocks of a partition B.
Closers cl(B): The set of all non-minimal elements in the blocks of a partition B.
Opener-Closer Configuration: A pair of sets (O, C) that can be realized as the openers and closers of some set partition.
Nesting Order (for Type C): The ordering 1 < 2 < ... < n < -n < ... < -2 < -1.
Crossing Order (for Type C): The ordering 1 < 2 < ... < n < -1 < -2 < ... < -n.

Assumptions
Visualization Convention: Set partitions are visualized by placing the numbers on a line and drawing arcs above them to connect consecutive elements of each block.
Classical Types: The paper focuses on set partitions corresponding to the classical Coxeter groups/reflection groups of types A, B, C, and D.
Symmetry in Type B/C/D: Partitions of types B, C, and D must obey a specific symmetry property with respect to negation: if B is a block, then so is -B = {-b | b ∈ B}.
Order-Dependent Definitions: The definitions of "crossing" and "nesting" for types other than A depend on specific, pre-defined orderings of the elements in [±n] (the "crossing order" and "nesting order").
Arc Definition in Type C: In the visual diagrams for Type C partitions, arcs are drawn by connecting elements that are consecutive in the nesting order, even when the elements on the line are arranged in the crossing order.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:cross-nest-A}

One of the goals of this article is to refine the following well known correspondences between
non-crossing and non-nesting set partitions.  For ordinary set partitions, a
\Dfn{crossing} consists of a pair of arcs $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ such that
$i<i'<j<j'$:

On the other hand, if $i<i'<j'<j$, we have a \Dfn{nesting}, pictorially:

A set partition of $[n]$ is called \Dfn{non-crossing} (resp. \Dfn{non-nesting})
if the number of crossings (resp. the number of nestings) equals $0$.

It has been known for a long time that the numbers of non-crossing and
non-nesting set-partitions of $[n]$ coincide.  More recently, Anisse Kasraoui
and Jiang Zeng have shown in~\cite{KasraouiZeng2006} that much more is true:
