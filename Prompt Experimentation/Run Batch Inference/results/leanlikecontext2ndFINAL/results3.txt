Below is the prompt for result #3:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any two vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}. This probability can be a function of n.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
Δ (Delta): The maximum degree (the largest number of edges connected to a single vertex) of the graph G_{n,p}.
V_1, ..., V_r: A collection of disjoint subsets of the vertices of G. In the context of strong colorability, this is a partition of all vertices.
k: A positive integer, typically representing the required number of colors and the size of each set V_i in a partition.
r: The number of disjoint sets (or "parts") in a partition of the vertices.
Independent Transversal: An independent set (a set of vertices with no edges between them) that contains exactly one vertex from each of the sets V_1, ..., V_r.
Strongly k-colorable: A property of a graph G. G is strongly k-colorable if for every partition of its vertices into r sets V_1, ..., V_r of size k, one can find a proper k-coloring where each color appears exactly once in each set V_i. (A small technical adjustment is made if k does not divide n).
sχ(G) (Strong Chromatic Number): The central parameter of study. It is the minimum integer k for which the graph G is strongly k-colorable.
θ (theta): An arbitrary small positive constant used to bound p away from 1.
ε (epsilon): An arbitrary small positive constant used to describe asymptotic bounds (e.g., (1+o(1))Δ).


Assumptions 
The results hold "almost surely" (a.s.), meaning the probability of the statement being true approaches 1 as the number of vertices n tends to infinity.
General Condition: For Theorem 1.1, it is assumed that the edge probability p is bounded away from 1, i.e., p < 1-θ for some constant θ > 0.
Conditions on Edge Probability p for the Strong Chromatic Number:
Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(i)): It is assumed that p is significantly larger than (log⁴n / n)¹/³. The notation used is p ≫ (log⁴n / n)¹/³.
Moderately Dense Case (Theorem 1.1(ii)): It is assumed that p is significantly larger than (log n / n)¹/². The notation used is p ≫ (log n / n)¹/².
Conditions for the Existence of an Independent Transversal (Theorem 1.2):
Sparse Case: It is assumed that the edge probability p is at least (log⁴n) / n, i.e., p ≥ (log⁴n) / n.
Part Size: It is assumed that the vertex set is partitioned into disjoint subsets V_i where the size of each part is at least (1+o(1))Δ. 



    Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you will write:
(\sigma \frac{\Delta}{\log
  n}\big) = o(\Delta)$ neighbors in $V_j$, since $\sigma \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log
  n}$.  Also, by construction of $I_1$, every part whose index is not in $I_1$ has at most
$\frac{\ep}{4} \Delta$ locally big vertices.  Hence the size of $V'_j$ is at least $|V_j|
-(1+o(1)) \Delta - \frac{\ep}{4} \Delta \geq \frac{\ep}{2} \Delta$, as claimed.

Let us say that a set $U_t$ satisfies property $\mathbf{Q}_t$ if for every $k \not \in
I_1 \cup J_t$, all the vertices in $U_t$ that
are not locally big with respect to $V_k$ have together at most
$300 (\tau - t)\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in $V_k$.
We need the following  analogue of Lemma \ref{lem:first-stage}.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:second-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $U_t$ is an independent transversal on $V'_{J_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{Q}_t$.  Then we can extend $U_t$ to $U_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V'_{J_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_{t-1}$.
\end{lemma}
We also postpone the proof of this lemma until Section \ref{sec:last-lemma}.
Starting with $U_\tau = \emptyset$, we iterate this lemma until we obtain $U_1$, an
independent transversal on $V'_{J_1}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_1$.
Since $\tau \leq \frac{2 \log n}{\log \log n}$, this property implies that each $V_k$
with $k \not \in I_1 \cup J_1$ has $O\big(\tau \frac{\Delta}{\log n}\big) = o(\Delta)$
vertices with neighbors in $U_1$.

Finally, let $K = [r] \setminus (I_1 \cup J_1)$.  Delete all neighbors of $T_1 \cup U_1$
and all locally big vertices from every $V_k$ with $k\in K$, and denote the resulting sets
by $V'_k$. All $V'_k$ will still have size at least $\big(1 + \frac{\ep}{2}\big) \Delta$,
but now no vertex there has more than $\frac{\Delta}{\log n}$ neighbors in any single set $V_k'$.
Thus, the following result from \cite{LS} implies that for sufficiently large $n$, there
is an independent transversal on $V'_K$, which completes $T_1 \cup U_1$ into an
independent transversal through all parts.
  



Task:
Based on the context, objects and assumptions above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #3 ---
### Theorem/Conjecture

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:main}
For any $\ep > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$, the following holds. If $p  \ge (1 + \ep) \frac{\log n}{n}$, then
$$
s \chi(G_{n,p}) \le (1 + 1/\ep) \Delta + 1 \le (1 + 2/\ep) \Delta
$$
with probability $1 - o(1)$.
\end{theorem}

### Proof Sketch

We have two cases to consider based on the size of $\Delta$.  If $\Delta \le \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$, then the theorem follows from a construction in \cite{LS}.  The other case ($\Delta \ge \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$) is handled by Theorem \ref{thm:main}.

### Rigorous Proof

We now fill in the details of the proof.

Here is the missing proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main}.
\begin{proof}
  If $\Delta \le \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$, the statement follows from Theorem 1.1 in \cite{LS}.  If $\Delta \ge \frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$, then the assertion follows from Theorem \ref{thm:main}.
\end{proof}

\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:indep-transversal}
For any $\ep > 0$, for all sufficiently large $n$, the following holds. If $p  \ge (1 + \ep) \frac{\log n}{n}$, then there exists an independent transversal of size $\Delta + o(\Delta)$ with probability $1 - o(1)$.
\end{theorem}
Here is the missing proof of Theorem \ref{thm:part-size}.
