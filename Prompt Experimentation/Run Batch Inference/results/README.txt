Results
This directory contains the output files from my prompting tests. Each file includes the specific prompt used and the corresponding text generated by the model.

File Format
Every result file follows a consistent structure to separate the input prompt from the model's output:

Below is the prompt for result #:

Paper Key
The number (#) found in each result file corresponds to one of the seven papers from our development set. This number indicates which paper's theorems were used to generate the prompt.

The papers are:

Restricted trees: simplifying networks with bottlenecks (ID: 1005.4956)

Crossings and nestings in set partitions of classical types (ID: 0904.1097)

On the strong chromatic number of random graphs (ID: 0706.2110)

On the singularity probability of discrete random matrices (ID: 0905.0461)

Partitioning complete graphs by heterochromatic trees (ID: 0711.2849)

The order of the largest complete minor in a random graph (ID: 0705.0325)

Graphs where every k-subset of vertices is an identifying set (ID: 0902.0443)
