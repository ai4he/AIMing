Below is the prompt for result #7:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
 Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges. A
subset $C\subseteq V$ is called \emph{identifying} if for every vertex $x\in V$
the intersection of $C$ and the closed neighbourhood of $x$ is nonempty, and
these intersections are different for different vertices $x$.
  Let $k$ be a positive integer. We will consider graphs where \emph{every}
$k$-subset is identifying. We prove that for every $k>1$ the maximal order of
such a graph is at most $2k-2.$ Constructions attaining the maximal order are
given for infinitely many values of $k.$
  The corresponding problem of $k$-subsets identifying any at most $\ell$
vertices is considered as well.  

--- Model Generation for result #7 ---
Let $k, \ell$ be positive integers, and let $G$ be a graph.
  If every $k$-subset of $V(G)$ is identifying and every $k$-subset identifies
at most $\ell$ vertices, then $|V(G)|\leq (k+1)(\ell+1)-2$.
