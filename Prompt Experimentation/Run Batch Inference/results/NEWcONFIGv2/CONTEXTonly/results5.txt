Below is the prompt for result #5:
Given the following context from a math paper please write a theorem that follows.


    Here is your context:
 rtex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. In \cite{chen},
the authors determined the heterochromatic tree partition number
of an $r$-edge-colored complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$. In this
paper we consider an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_{n}$ and give
the exact expression for its heterochromatic tree partition number. \\

Before proceeding, we introduce some definitions and notations.
Throughout this paper, we use $r$ to denote the number of the
colors, and an $r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ means that each
color appears at least once in $G$. Let $\phi$ be an
$r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$. For an edge $e\in E(G)$, denote
by $\phi(e)$ the color of $e$. Denote by $t_r(G, \phi)$ the
minimum positive integer $p$ such that under the $r$-edge-coloring
$\phi$, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$
vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. Clearly, $t_r(G)=\max
_{\phi} t_r(G, \phi)$, where $\phi$ runs over all
$r$-edge-colorings of the graph $G$. Let $\phi$ be an
$r$-edge-coloring of the graph $G$ and $F$ be a spanning forest of
$G$, each component of which is a heterochromatic tree. If $F$
contains exactly $t_r(G, \phi)$ components, then $F$ is called an
{\it optimal heterochromatic tree partition} of the graph $G$ with
edge-coloring $\phi$. Note that a tree consisting of a single
vertex is also regarded as a heterochromatic tree. \\

For any integer $r\geq 2$, there is a unique positive integer $t$,
such that ${t\choose 2} +2\leq r\leq {{t+1}\choose 2} +1$.
Clearly, the integer $t$ is determined completely by $r$, and here
we denote it by $f(r)=t$. This integer $f(r)=t$ will play an
important role in expressing the number $t_r(K_n)$. If the color
number $r=1$, clearly a maximum matching (plus a single vertex
when $n$ is odd) in $K_n$ is an optimal heterochromatic tree
partition, and then $t_r(K_n)=\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. So, in
the rest of this paper we only consider the case $2\leq r\leq
{n\choose 2}$. The following is the main result of this paper.   

--- Model Generation for result #5 ---
\label{main} For an integer $n\geq 2$, we have
\begin{align}
t_r(K_n) = \left\{
 \begin{array}{lll}
\frac{n}{2} & \text{if }
r\leq {{n-1}\choose 2} \text{ and } r\geq 2, \\
\lceil \frac{1}{2d}\left({d\choose 2} +r-1+\gamma(n,d)\right)\rceil
& \text{if }{{n-1}\choose 2}> r> {n\choose 2} -{n-1\choose 2}
\text{ and } d=f(r), \\
\lceil \frac{1}{2}\left({n\choose 2} -r+1\right)\rceil & \text{if }
{n\choose 2} -{n-1\choose 2} \geq r \geq {n\choose 2}-{n-1\choose 2} +
\frac{n-1}{2}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{align}
where $\lceil x\rceil$ denotes the smallest integer that is greater
than or equal to $x$, and $\gamma(n,d)=1$ if $n\equiv
0(\textit{mod}d)$, otherwise $\gamma(n,d)=0$.
