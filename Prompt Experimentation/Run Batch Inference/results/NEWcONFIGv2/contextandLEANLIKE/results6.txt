Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following objects, assumptions and context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any pair of vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
ccl(G): A function that returns the order (i.e., the number of vertices) of the largest complete minor in graph G.
b: A parameter defined as b := 1/(1-p).
ε (epsilon): An arbitrarily small positive constant used to frame the precision of the result (e.g., in (1 ± ε)).
C: A constant, whose value depends on ε, that defines the lower bound for the average degree (np) in the main theorem.
c: A fixed constant greater than 1, used to define the edge probability in the sparse case (p = c/n).
δ (delta): A constant, whose value depends on the constant c.

Assumptions
The results are presented as theorems that hold under specific constraints on the parameters. The key assumptions are the conditions stated in the "if" part of the theorems.
Asymptotic Analysis: All results are for the limit where n (the number of vertices) tends to infinity. The conclusions hold "asymptotically almost surely" (a.a.s.), meaning with a probability that approaches 1 as n grows.
Conditions on Edge Probability p:
For Corollary 1.3, it is assumed that the edge probability p is in the range C/n ≤ p ≤ 1-ε. This means the average degree (np) is at least some large constant C, and p is bounded away from 1.
For Theorem 1.4, it is assumed that the edge probability p is exactly p = c/n, where c is a fixed constant greater than 1. 

Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you write:
 })=(1 \pm \eps)n/\sqrt{\log_b n}$,
where $b:=1/(1-p)$. Here~$G_{n,p}$ is a random graph on~$n$ vertices
where the edges are present independently and with probability~$p$.
We say that an event occurs \emph{asymptotically almost surely} (a.a.s.)
if it occurs with probability tending to~$1$ as~$n$ tends to infinity.

Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} considered the order of the largest
complete minor in a sparser random graph (and more generally in arbitrary
pseudo-random and expanding graphs).
%They observed that the proof in~\cite{BCE} can be extended to the case
%$p 	o 0$ as long as $p$ is not too small, but that it breaks down eventually.
They determined the order of magnitude of~ccl$(G_{n,p})$
as long as~$p\ge n^{\eps-1}$. Our first result determines~ccl$(G_{n,p})$ asymptotically
as long as $p\ge C/n$ and $p=o(1)$.

egin{thm}\label{thmdense}
For every $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $pn\ge C$
and $p=o(1)$, then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) \sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}}. $$
\end{thm}

One can combine Theorem~ef{thmdense} with~\cite{BCE} to obtain
a single formula which allows for constant~$p$ as well. Indeed, let $b:=1/(1-p)$.
If $p=o(1)$ a series expansion gives $\ln b=-\ln (1-p)=p+O(p^2)$.
Thus
$$
\sqrt{rac{n^2p}{\ln (np)}} = \sqrt{rac{n^2 p}{\ln b\log_b (np)}}
=(1+o(1)){n \over \sqrt{\log_b (np)}}.
$$
Also if~$p$ is constant, then $\log_b n=(1+o(1))\log_b(np)$.
So altogether we obtain the following.
egin{corollary}\label{thmdense1}
For every  $\eps>0$ there exists a constant $C=C(\eps)$ such that if $C/n \le p \le 1-\eps$,
then a.a.s.
$${m ccl}(G_{n,p})=(1\pm \eps) rac{n}{\sqrt{\log_{b} (np)}}. $$
\end{corollary}

In the last section of the paper, we estimate~ccl$(G_{n,c/n})$ where $c>1$ is fixed.
Krivelevich and Sudakov~\cite{KS} observed that there are constants~$c_1$ and~$c_2$
such that $c_1\sqrt{n /\log n}\le {m ccl}(G_{n,c/n})\le c_2\sqrt{n}$
and asked what the correct order of magnitude is.
 



--- Model Generation for result #6 ---
\label{thmsparse}
For every $c>1$ there exists a constant $C=C(c)$ such that if $p=c/n$, and $n$ is sufficiently large, then a.a.s.
$${
    ccl}(G_{n,p})= (1+o(1))  \sqrt{n \over \log n}.$$
