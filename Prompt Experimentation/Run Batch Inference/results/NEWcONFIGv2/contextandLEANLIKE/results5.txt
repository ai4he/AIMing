Below is the prompt for result #5:
Given the following objects, assumptions and context from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects
G: A general graph.
K_n: A complete graph with n vertices (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). This is the primary object of study.
r: The number of colors used in an edge-coloring of a graph.
n: The number of vertices in the complete graph K_n.
Heterochromatic Tree: A tree where every edge has a different color. A single vertex is also considered a heterochromatic tree.
ϕ (phi): A specific r-edge-coloring of a graph G, which is a function that assigns one of r colors to each edge.
t_r(G) (Heterochromatic Tree Partition Number): The central parameter of study. It is the minimum integer p such that for any r-edge-coloring of the graph G, its vertices can be covered by at most p vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees.
t: An integer derived from r.
f(r): A function that maps the number of colors r to the integer t, defined by the inequality t(t-1)/2 + 2 ≤ r ≤ (t+1)t/2 + 1.

Assumptions
Scope of r: The number of colors r is assumed to be in the range 2 ≤ r ≤ n(n-1)/2. The case r=1 is considered trivial. n(n-1)/2 is the total number of edges in K_n.
Coloring Requirement: An r-edge-coloring means that each of the r colors is used at least once on some edge of the graph.
Worst-Case Scenario: The value of t_r(G) is determined by the "worst-case" coloring. It is the maximum number of partitions required over all possible r-edge-colorings of the graph G.
 

Here is the context directly proceeding the theorem you write:
 rtex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. In \cite{chen},
the authors determined the heterochromatic tree partition number
of an $r$-edge-colored complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$. In this
paper we consider an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_{n}$ and give
the exact expression for its heterochromatic tree partition number. \\

Before proceeding, we introduce some definitions and notations.
Throughout this paper, we use $r$ to denote the number of the
colors, and an $r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ means that each
color appears at least once in $G$. Let $\phi$ be an
$r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$. For an edge $e\in E(G)$, denote
by $\phi(e)$ the color of $e$. Denote by $t_r(G, \phi)$ the
minimum positive integer $p$ such that under the $r$-edge-coloring
$\phi$, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$
vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. Clearly, $t_r(G)=\max
_{\phi} t_r(G, \phi)$, where $\phi$ runs over all
$r$-edge-colorings of the graph $G$. Let $\phi$ be an
$r$-edge-coloring of the graph $G$ and $F$ be a spanning forest of
$G$, each component of which is a heterochromatic tree. If $F$
contains exactly $t_r(G, \phi)$ components, then $F$ is called an
{\it optimal heterochromatic tree partition} of the graph $G$ with
edge-coloring $\phi$. Note that a tree consisting of a single
vertex is also regarded as a heterochromatic tree. \\

For any integer $r\geq 2$, there is a unique positive integer $t$,
such that ${t\choose 2} +2\leq r\leq {{t+1}\choose 2} +1$.
Clearly, the integer $t$ is determined completely by $r$, and here
we denote it by $f(r)=t$. This integer $f(r)=t$ will play an
important role in expressing the number $t_r(K_n)$. If the color
number $r=1$, clearly a maximum matching (plus a single vertex
when $n$ is odd) in $K_n$ is an optimal heterochromatic tree
partition, and then $t_r(K_n)=\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. So, in
the rest of this paper we only consider the case $2\leq r\leq
{n\choose 2}$. The following is the main result of this paper.
