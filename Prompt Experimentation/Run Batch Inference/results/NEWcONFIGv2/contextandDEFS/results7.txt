Below is the prompt for result #7:
 You are a mathematician specializing in combinatorics and graph theory, with a focus on identifying codes and extremal problems. Your task is to read the provided mathematical context and generate a plausible, non-trivial theorem or conjecture that logically follows from it. To ensure you understand the specific vocabulary, use the following definitions.

\subsection*{Definitions}
egin{enumerate}
    \item 	extbf{Closed Neighborhood $N[x]$:} For a vertex $x$ in a graph $G$, its closed neighborhood $N[x]$ is the set containing $x$ and all vertices adjacent to $x$.
    \item 	extbf{Identifying Set (or Identifying Code):} A subset of vertices $C$ is an identifying set if for every vertex $x$, the set $N[x] \cap C$ is non-empty, and for any two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$, $N[x] \cap C 
eq N[y] \cap C$.
    \item 	extbf{$k$-Universally Identifying Graph:} A graph $G$ is $k$-universally identifying if \emph{every} subset of its vertices of size $k$ is an identifying set.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Context}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges. A
subset $C\subseteq V$ is called \emph{identifying} if for every vertex $x\in V$
the intersection of $C$ and the closed neighbourhood of $x$ is nonempty, and
these intersections are different for different vertices $x$.
  Let $k$ be a positive integer. We will consider graphs where \emph{every}
$k$-subset is identifying. We prove that for every $k>1$ the maximal order of
such a graph is at most $2k-2.$ Constructions attaining the maximal order are
given for infinitely many values of $k.$
  The corresponding problem of $k$-subsets identifying any at most $\ell$
vertices is considered as well. 


Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.


--- Model Generation for result #7 ---
\label{thm:main}
    Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected loopless graph. Let $C\subseteq V$ be an arbitrary subset of $V$. Then $C$ is an identifying set if and only if $|C|\geq \max_{x\in V}|N[x]\cap C|$.
