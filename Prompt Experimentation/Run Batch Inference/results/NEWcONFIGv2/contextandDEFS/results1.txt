Below is the prompt for result #1:
 You are a mathematician specializing in phylogenetic combinatorics and graph theory. Your task is to read the provided mathematical context and generate a plausible, non-trivial theorem or conjecture that logically follows from it. To ensure you understand the specific vocabulary, here are some definitions.

\subsection*{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{X-network:} An X-network $N = (V, A, r, X)$ is a digraph $(V, A)$ with root $r$ such that
    (1) there is a one-to-one map $\phi : X \to V$ such that the image of $\phi$ is the set of
    all leaves of $(V, A)$, and
    (2) for every $v \in V$ there is a leaf $u$ and a directed path from $v$ to $u$.
    Thus the set of leaves of $N$ may be identified with the set $X$; every vertex is
    ancestral to a leaf.
    In biology most X-networks are acyclic. The set $X$ provides a context for $N$,
    giving a hypothesized relationship among the members of $X$. For convenience,
    we will write $x$ for the leaf $\phi(x)$.
    \item \textbf{X-tree:} An X-tree is an X-network such that the underlying digraph is a rooted tree.
    \item \textbf{Digraph:} A directed graph or digraph $N = (V, A)$ consists of a finite set $V$ of vertices and a finite set $A$ of arcs, each consisting of an ordered pair $(u, v)$ where $u \in V, v \in V, u \neq v$.
    \item \textbf{Connected:} A graph $G = (V, E)$ is connected if, given any two distinct $v$ and $w$ in $V$ there exists a sequence $v = v_0, v_1, v_2, \dots , v_k = w$ of vertices such that for $i = 0, \dots , k-1$, $\{v_i , v_{i+1}\} \in E$. A subset $W$ of $V$ is connected if the induced subgraph $G[W]$ is connected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mathematical Context}
 human population forms a tight cluster.  If $N$ is successively cluster-distinct, the same argument would suggest that it forms a restricted set.

A restricted CSD map $f: N \to N'$ is \emph{universal (for restricted maps)} provided that given any restricted map $g: N \to N''$  there is a unique restricted CSD map $h: N' \to N''$ such that $g = h \circ f$.

We shall see below that the natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is universal for restricted maps.

The first result is that the image of a restricted map is always a tree.

\begin{thm}%4.1
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network and let $T = (V',A',r',X)$ be an $X$-network.  Assume $f: N \to T$ is a restricted CSD map.  Then $T$ is a tree.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We show that $T$ has no hybrid vertices.  Suppose otherwise, so we may assume $V'$ contains distinct vertices $u_1'$, $u_2'$, and $u_3'$ while $A'$ contains arcs $(u_1',u_3')$, $(u_2', u_3')$.  Let $B_i = f^{-1}(u_i')$.  Since $f$ is restricted, each $B_i$ is a restricted set.  Since $f$ is a CSD map, there exist $u_1 \in B_1$, $w_1 \in B_3$, $u_2 \in B_2$, and  $w_2 \in B_3$ such that $(u_1,w_1)$ and $(u_2,w_2)$ are arcs of $N$.  Note $u_1 \notin B_3$ and $u_2 \notin B_3$.  Since $B_3$ is restricted, it follows $u_1 = Anc(B_3)$ and $u_2 = Anc(B_3)$.  Hence $u_1 = u_2$ so $u_1' = f(u_1) = f(u_2) = u_2'$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}%Cor 4.2.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  Then $ResTr(N)$ is an $X$-tree.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
The natural projection map $\phi: N \to ResTr(N)$ is a restricted CSD map.
\end{proof}


The next result shows that many relationships among leaves observed in $ResTr(N)$ are also present in $N$.

\begin{cor}%Cor 4.3.
Let $N=(V,A,r,X)$ be an acyclic $X$-network.  There is a wired lift of $ResTr(N)$ into $N$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Theorem 2.5.
\end{proof}


Restricted maps have interesting functorial properties, as seen in the next results. 


Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.
