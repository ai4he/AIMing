Below is the prompt for result #2:
You are a mathematician specializing in enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Your task is to read the provided mathematical context and generate a plausible, non-trivial theorem or conjecture that logically follows from it. To ensure you understand the specific vocabulary, use the following definitions.

\subsection*{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Set Partition:} A \Dfn{set partition} of $[n]:= \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of pairwise disjoint, non-empty subsets of $[n]$, called \Dfn{blocks}, whose union is $[n]$.
    \item \textbf{Crossing:} For ordinary set partitions, a
    \Dfn{crossing} consists of a pair of arcs $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ such that
    $i<i'<j<j'$:

    \item \textbf{Nesting:} If $i<i'<j'<j$, we have a \Dfn{nesting}, pictorially:

    \end{center}
    A set partition of $[n]$ is called \Dfn{non-crossing} (resp. \Dfn{non-nesting})
    if the number of crossings (resp. the number of nestings) equals $0$.
    \item \textbf{Opener and Closer:} The \Dfn{openers} $\op(\mathcal{B})$ are the non-maximal elements of the blocks in $\mathcal{B}$, whereas the \Dfn{closers} $\cl(\mathcal{B})$ are its non-minimal elements.

\label{sec:cross-nest-A}

One of the goals of this article is to refine the following well known correspondences between
non-crossing and non-nesting set partitions.  For ordinary set partitions, a
\Dfn{crossing} consists of a pair of arcs $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ such that
$i<i'<j<j'$:
\begin{center}
  \setlength{\unitlength}{20pt}

    \put(4.75,0){\hbox{$i'$}}
    \put(5.75,0){\hbox{$<$}}
    \put(7,0){\hbox{$j$}}
    \put(8,0){\hbox{$<$}}

\end{center}
On the other hand, if $i<i'<j'<j$, we have a \Dfn{nesting}, pictorially:
\begin{center}
  \setlength{\unitlength}{20pt}

    \put(5.75,0){\hbox{$<$}}
    \put(7,0){\hbox{$j'$}}
    \put(8,0){\hbox{$<$}}
    \put(9.25,0){\hbox{$j$}}
    \put(10.25,0){\hbox{$\ldots$}}
    \put(11.75,0){\hbox{$n$}}

A set partition of $[n]$ is called \Dfn{non-crossing} (resp. \Dfn{non-nesting})
if the number of crossings (resp. the number of nestings) equals $0$.

It has been known for a long time that the numbers of non-crossing and
non-nesting set-partitions of $[n]$ coincide.  More recently, Anisse Kasraoui
and Jiang Zeng have shown in~\cite{KasraouiZeng2006} that much more is true:
  


Task:
Based on the definitions and context above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.


--- Model Generation for result #2 ---
[Kasraoui-Zeng]
  Let $n$ be any positive integer.  The number of set partitions of $[n]$ which
  have the same number of non-crossing blocks as non-nesting blocks
  equals the number of set partitions of $[n]$ which have the same number of
  openers as closers.
