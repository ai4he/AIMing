Below is the prompt for result #2:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 In this article, we investigate bijections on various classes of set
partitions of classical types that preserve openers and closers. On the one
hand we present bijections that interchange crossings and nestings. For types B
and C, they generalize a construction by Kasraoui and Zeng for type A, whereas
for type D, we were only able to construct a bijection between non-crossing and
non-nesting set partitions. On the other hand we generalize a bijection to type
B and C that interchanges the cardinality of the maximal crossing with the
cardinality of the maximal nesting, as given by Chen, Deng, Du, Stanley and Yan
for type A. Using a variant of this bijection, we also settle a conjecture by
Soll and Welker concerning generalized type B triangulations and symmetric fans
of Dyck paths. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{thm:k-crossing-A}
  There is an explicit bijection on set partitions, preserving the set of
  openers and the set of closers, and interchanging the cardinalities of the
  maximal crossing and the maximal nesting.



\label{thm:crossings-C}
  There is an explicit bijection on set partitions of type $C$, preserving the
  set of openers and the set of closers, and interchanging the number of
  crossings and the number of nestings.


\label{thm:k-crossing-C}
  There is an explicit bijection on set partitions of type $C$, preserving the
  set of openers and the set of closers, and interchanging the cardinalities of
  the maximal crossing and the maximal nesting.


There is an explicit bijection on set partitions of type $B$, preserving the
  set of openers and the set of closers, and mapping the number of nestings to
  the number of crossings.


\label{thm:k-crossing-B}
  There is an explicit bijection on set partitions of type $B$, preserving the
  set of openers and the set of closers, and interchanging the cardinalities of
  the maximal crossing and the maximal nesting.



    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.
