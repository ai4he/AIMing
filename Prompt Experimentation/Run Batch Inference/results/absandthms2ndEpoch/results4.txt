Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let $M_n$ be an $n$ by $n$ random matrix where each entry is +1 or -1
independently with probability 1/2. Our main result implies that the
probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$,
improving on the previous best upper bound of $(3/4 + o(1))^n$ proven by Tao
and Vu in arXiv:math/0501313v2. This paper follows a similar approach to the
Tao and Vu result, including using a variant of their structure theorem. We
also extend this type of exponential upper bound on the probability that a
random matrix is singular to a large class of discrete random matrices taking
values in the complex numbers, where the entries are independent but are not
necessarily identically distributed. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{noSthm}
For every $\epsilon >0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that the following holds.
Let $\fmat$ be an $n$ by $n$ complex matrix in which $\fxt$ rows contain
fixed, non-random entries and where the other rows contain entries that are
independent discrete random variables.  If the fixed rows have co-rank $k$ and
if for every random entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha = x) \le
1-\epsilon$, then for all sufficiently large $n$
$$\Pr(\fmat \mbox{ has co-rank } >k)\le (1-\delta)^{n-\fxt}.$$
%
%$\fxt$ linearly independent rows
%containing fixed complex numbers and with the remaining rows containing
%independent discrete random variables, and if for every random entry $\alpha$
%we have
%$\max_x\Pr(\alpha=x) \le 1-\epsilon$, then
%$$\Pr(M_n \mbox{ is singular}) \le (1-\delta)^{n-\fxt}.$$

[\cite{VWnote}]\label{reduction theorem}
Let $\sov$ be a finite subset of $\bb C$.  There exist infinitely many
primes $Q$ such that there is a ring homomorphism $\qmap:\Z[\sov] \to \Zmodp$
satisfying the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]  the map $\qmap$ is injective on $\sov$, and
\item[(ii)]  for any $n$ by $n$ matrix $(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}$ with entries $s_{ij}\in S$,
we have $$\det\lt(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}\rt) = 0 \quad\mbox{ if and only if } \quad
\det\left(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(\qmap(s_{ij}))_{1\le i,j\le n}\right)=0.$$
\end{enumerate}



[Small combinatorial dimension, \cite{KKS}, \cite{TV1}, \cite{TV2}]
\label{smalldim}
For any $\delta >0$ we have
\[
\sum_{\dpm \in \MC D \ \mathrm{s.t.}\ p^{n-\dpm}\le \delta^n}
\quad
\sum_{V \in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) \le n \delta^n.
\]



[Large combinatorial dimension, \cite{KKS},\cite{TV1},\cite{TV2}]\label{large dim}
We have
\[
\sum_{\dpm \in \MC D \ \mathrm{s.t.}\ \frac{\largedimconstant}{\sqrt n}\le p^{n-\dpm}}
\quad
\sum_{V \in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) \le (p+\littleo{1})^n
\]


    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

\begin{theorem}\label{main}
Let $M$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix in which each entry is an independent discrete random variable taking values in $\{-1,1\}$. Then, as $n$ tends to infinity, the probability that $M$ is singular is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$.
