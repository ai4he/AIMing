Below is the prompt for result #3:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let G be a graph with n vertices, and let k be an integer dividing n. G is
said to be strongly k-colorable if for every partition of V(G) into disjoint
sets V_1 \cup ... \cup V_r, all of size exactly k, there exists a proper vertex
k-coloring of G with each color appearing exactly once in each V_i. In the case
when k does not divide n, G is defined to be strongly k-colorable if the graph
obtained by adding k \lceil n/k ceil - n isolated vertices is strongly
k-colorable. The strong chromatic number of G is the minimum k for which G is
strongly k-colorable. In this paper, we study the behavior of this parameter
for the random graph G(n, p). In the dense case when p >> n^{-1/3}, we prove
that the strong chromatic number is a.s. concentrated on one value \Delta+1,
where \Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. We also obtain several weaker
results for sparse random graphs. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{lem:first-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $T_t$ is an independent transversal on $V_{I_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{P}_t$.  Then we can extend $T_t$ to $T_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V_{I_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$.


\label{lem:second-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $U_t$ is an independent transversal on $V'_{J_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{Q}_t$.  Then we can extend $U_t$ to $U_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V'_{J_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_{t-1}$.


\label{thm:main}
  Let $\Delta$ be the maximum degree of the random graph $\gnp$, where $p < 1-\theta$
  for any arbitrary constant $\theta > 0$.
  \begin{description}
  \item[\hspace{12pt}\textbf{(i)}] If $p \gg \left(\frac{\log^4 n}{n}\right)^{1/3}$, then
almost surely the strong chromatic
    number of $\gnp$ equals $\Delta+1$.
\item[\hspace{12pt}\textbf{(ii)}] If $p \gg \left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{1/2}$, then a.s.\ the strong chromatic
    number of $\gnp$ is $(1+o(1))\Delta$.
  \end{description}



\label{thm:main2}
Let $\Delta$ be the maximum degree of the random graph $\gnp$. If
$p \geq \frac{\log^4 n}{n}$,
then almost surely every collection of disjoint subsets $V_1, \ldots, V_r$ of $\gnp$ with all
$|V_i|\geq (1+o(1))\Delta$ has an independent transversal.
 

    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

### Strictly speaking, your task is to write a theorem that could be useful in the paper. 

### Theorem:

Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and let $k \leq n$ be an integer. Then $G$ is strongly $k$-colorable if and only if it is $(k-1)$-colorable. 

### Proof:

If $G$ is strongly $k$-colorable, then it is also $(k-1)$-colorable because every proper $(k-1)$-coloring is almost surely a proper $k$-coloring.

If $G$ is $(k-1)$-colorable, then, by definition, there exists a partition of $G$ into $(k-1)$ vertex sets such that every set contains at most $(k-1)$ vertices. For any other partition of $G$, there exists a set with at most $(k-1)$ vertices which is a subset of the $(k-1)$ sets in the definition of strong colorability.
