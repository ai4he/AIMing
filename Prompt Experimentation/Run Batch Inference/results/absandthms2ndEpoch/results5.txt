Below is the prompt for result #5:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 A {\it heterochromatic tree} is an edge-colored tree in which any two edges
have different colors. The {\it heterochromatic tree partition number} of an
$r$-edge-colored graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is the minimum positive
integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$ are colored with $r$
colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$ vertex-disjoint
heterochromatic trees. In this paper we determine the heterochromatic tree
partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{inequ}
$t_{r+1}(K_n)\leq t_{r}(K_n)$.


\label{cutedge}
Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$. If $G$ contains a
cut-edge, then $|E(G)|\leq {{n-1}\choose 2}+1$.\qed \\


    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

### Response

Based on the problem statement, I will provide a new theorem that can be used to prove the paper. Here is the theorem:

\begin{theorem}
The heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ is at most $n$.

\label{thm1}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows from the fact that the heterochromatic trees of $K_n$ are exactly the edges of $K_n$. Since there are $n$ edges in $K_n$, we can partition $K_n$ into at most $n$ heterochromatic trees.
\end{proof}

To make this theorem more rigorous, we need to say a bit more about what we mean by ``heterochromatic trees''. We will define a heterochromatic tree as an edge-colored tree in which any two edges have different colors. We will define a heterochromatic tree partition as a partition of the vertex set $V(K_n)$ into subsets such that the subgraph induced by each subset forms a heterochromatic tree. The theorem then states that the minimum number of heterochromatic trees needed to partition $K_n$ is at most $n$.

We can then prove this theorem as follows. Let $G$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices and $r$ colors. We can partition the vertices of $G$ into $r$ sets such that each set induces a heterochromatic tree. Then, since $G$ is complete, each edge of $G$ is present in at least one of the heterochromatic trees. Since there are $n$ edges in $G$, we can partition $G$ into at most $n$ heterochromatic trees. This proves the theorem. 

\qed

I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation.

### Response

Great! Here is the theorem and its proof in LaTeX:

\begin{theorem}
The heterochromatic tree partition number of an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ is at most $n$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows from the fact that the heterochromatic trees of $K_n$ are exactly the edges of $K_n$. Since there are $n$ edges in $K_n$, we can partition $K_n$ into at most $n$ heterochromatic trees.
\end{proof}

\qed
