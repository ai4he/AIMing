Below is the prompt for result #7:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph without loops and multiple edges. A
subset $C\subseteq V$ is called \emph{identifying} if for every vertex $x\in V$
the intersection of $C$ and the closed neighbourhood of $x$ is nonempty, and
these intersections are different for different vertices $x$.
  Let $k$ be a positive integer. We will consider graphs where \emph{every}
$k$-subset is identifying. We prove that for every $k>1$ the maximal order of
such a graph is at most $2k-2.$ Constructions attaining the maximal order are
given for infinitely many values of $k.$
  The corresponding problem of $k$-subsets identifying any at most $\ell$
vertices is considered as well. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{Tcond}
Suppose that $G=(V,E)\in \Gr(n,k,\ell)$,
where $n>k$ and $\ell\ge2$.
Then the following conditions hold:
\begin{romenumerate}
 \item For all $x\in V$ we have $\ell+1< n-k+\ell+1\le |N[x]|\le
 k-\ell$.
In other words, $\gd_G\ge n-k+\ell$ and $\Delta_G\le k-\ell-1$.
 \item For all $x,y\in V$, $x\ne y$, $|N[x]\cap N[y]|\le k-2\ell+1$.
\item
$n\le 2k-2\ell-1$ and $k\ge 2\ell+2$.
\end{romenumerate}


\label{GoodL}
For $\ell\geq 2$, $\NN(k,\ell)\le \max\bigset{\frac{\ell}{\ell-1}(k-2),k}$.


\label{Tl2}
  If $k\le 5$, then $\Xi(k,2)=k$. If $k\ge6$, then
$$\Xi(k,2)< \Bigpar{1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}(k-2)+\frac14.$$



Let $\ell\ge 2$ and $m\ge \max\{2\ell-2,4\}$. A binary hypercube of
 dimension $m$ belongs to $\Gr(2^m,2^m-m+2\ell-2,\ell)$


The smallest $n\ge2$ such that there exists a connected graph (or a
graph without isolated vertices) in $\Gr(n,n,2)$ is $n=7$. 

    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.
