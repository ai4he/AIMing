Below is the prompt for result #3:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let G be a graph with n vertices, and let k be an integer dividing n. G is
said to be strongly k-colorable if for every partition of V(G) into disjoint
sets V_1 \cup ... \cup V_r, all of size exactly k, there exists a proper vertex
k-coloring of G with each color appearing exactly once in each V_i. In the case
when k does not divide n, G is defined to be strongly k-colorable if the graph
obtained by adding k \lceil n/k ceil - n isolated vertices is strongly
k-colorable. The strong chromatic number of G is the minimum k for which G is
strongly k-colorable. In this paper, we study the behavior of this parameter
for the random graph G(n, p). In the dense case when p >> n^{-1/3}, we prove
that the strong chromatic number is a.s. concentrated on one value \Delta+1,
where \Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. We also obtain several weaker
results for sparse random graphs. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

\label{lem:first-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $T_t$ is an independent transversal on $V_{I_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{P}_t$.  Then we can extend $T_t$ to $T_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V_{I_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$.


\label{lem:second-stage}
  Suppose $t > 1$, and $U_t$ is an independent transversal on $V'_{J_t}$ which satisfies
  $\mathbf{Q}_t$.  Then we can extend $U_t$ to $U_{t-1}$, an independent transversal on
  $V'_{J_{t-1}}$ which satisfies $\mathbf{Q}_{t-1}$.


\label{thm:main}
  Let $\Delta$ be the maximum degree of the random graph $\gnp$, where $p < 1-\theta$
  for any arbitrary constant $\theta > 0$.
  \begin{description}
  \item[\hspace{12pt}\textbf{(i)}] If $p \gg \left(\frac{\log^4 n}{n}\right)^{1/3}$, then
almost surely the strong chromatic
    number of $\gnp$ equals $\Delta+1$.
\item[\hspace{12pt}\textbf{(ii)}] If $p \gg \left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)^{1/2}$, then a.s.\ the strong chromatic
    number of $\gnp$ is $(1+o(1))\Delta$.
  \end{description}



\label{thm:main2}
Let $\Delta$ be the maximum degree of the random graph $\gnp$. If
$p \geq \frac{\log^4 n}{n}$,
then almost surely every collection of disjoint subsets $V_1, \ldots, V_r$ of $\gnp$ with all
$|V_i|\geq (1+o(1))\Delta$ has an independent transversal.
 

    
Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

### Abstract and Theorems

The abstract discusses the **strong chromatic number** of a graph \( G \), defined as the smallest integer \( k \) for which \( G \) is **strongly \( k \)-colorable**. A graph \( G \) is **strongly \( k \)-colorable** if for every partition of its vertex set into \( r \) subsets of size \( k \) (where \( r = \lceil n/k \rceil \) if \( k \) does not divide \( n \)), there exists a proper vertex \( k \)-coloring of \( G \) where each color class exactly covers each subset.

Key theorems in the abstract:
1. **Theorem for dense graphs (\( p \gg n^{-1/3} \))**: The strong chromatic number is \( \Delta + 1 \) with high probability.
2. **Theorem for sparse graphs (\( p \gg n^{-1/2} \))**: The strong chromatic number is \( (1 + o(1))\Delta \).

### New Theorem

**Theorem**: Let \( G \) be a random graph \( \gnp \) with \( p = p(n) \). If \( p \gg n^{-1/3} \), then the strong chromatic number of \( G \) is \( \Delta + 1 \) almost surely.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. For \( p \gg n^{-1/3} \), \( \Delta \) is \( \Theta(1) \) with high probability.
2. The condition \( p \gg n^{-1/3} \) ensures that the graph is dense enough that the worst-case partitions are not too large.
3. The proof involves showing that for such \( p \), any partition \( V_1 \cup \dots \cup V_r \) of the vertex set into subsets of size \( k \) (where \( k \) divides \( n \) if possible) can be "covered" by a proper coloring where each color is used exactly once in each \( V_i \). This is done by leveraging the independence of the random graph structure and probabilistic methods.

### Formalization

```lean4
theorem strong_chromatic_number_dense_graph (G : Type) [RandomGraph G] (p : ℝ) (Δ : ℕ) :
  p > (1 / (Nat.sqrt (Nat.sqrt n))) →
  Strongly kColorable G ↔ k = Δ + 1 := by
  sorry
```

### Explanation

1. The Lean4 theorem statement assumes a random graph model `G` with parameters `p` and `Δ` (the maximum degree).
2. The condition `p > 1 / (sqrt(sqrt(n)))` ensures the graph is dense enough.
3. The theorem asserts that `G` is strongly `k`-colorable if and only if `k = Δ + 1`.

### Conclusion

This theorem formalizes the first key result of the abstract: the strong chromatic number for dense random graphs. The proof would rely on showing that the random graph under the given density condition satisfies the condition for strong colorability. The Lean4 theorem captures this precise condition, and the `sorry` placeholder indicates where the proof would go in a complete formalization.
