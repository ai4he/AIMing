Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following abstarct from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.
    
    Here is your abstarct:
 Let $M_n$ be an $n$ by $n$ random matrix where each entry is +1 or -1
independently with probability 1/2. Our main result implies that the
probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$,
improving on the previous best upper bound of $(3/4 + o(1))^n$ proven by Tao
and Vu in arXiv:math/0501313v2. This paper follows a similar approach to the
Tao and Vu result, including using a variant of their structure theorem. We
also extend this type of exponential upper bound on the probability that a
random matrix is singular to a large class of discrete random matrices taking
values in the complex numbers, where the entries are independent but are not
necessarily identically distributed. 
    
      
    
    Here are some related theorems from the paper or related sources to consider when writing your theorem:

For every $\epsilon >0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that the following holds.
Let $\fmat$ be an $n$ by $n$ complex matrix in which $\fxt$ rows contain
fixed, non-random entries and where the other rows contain entries that are
independent discrete random variables.  If the fixed rows have co-rank $k$ and
if for every random entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha = x) \le
1-\epsilon$, then for all sufficiently large $n$
$$\Pr(\fmat \mbox{ has co-rank } >k)\le (1-\delta)^{n-\fxt}.$$

Let $\sov$ be a finite subset of $\bb C$.  There exist infinitely many
primes $Q$ such that there is a ring homomorphism $\qmap:\Z[\sov] \to \Zmodp$
satisfying the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]  the map $\qmap$ is injective on $\sov$, and
\item[(ii)]  for any $n$ by $n$ matrix $(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}$ with entries $s_{ij}\in S$,
we have $$\det\lt(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}\rt) = 0 \quad\mbox{ if and only if } \quad
\det\left(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(\qmap(s_{ij}))_{1\le i,j\le n}\right)=0.$$

Task:
Based on the theorems and abstarct above, state and rigorously formulate a new theorem or conjecture.

--- Model Generation for result #4 ---
### 1. Understanding the Problem

First, I need to understand the abstract and the related theorems to identify the key mathematical objects and concepts involved. The abstract is about the probability that a random $n \times n$ matrix with entries being either $+1$ or $-1$ is singular. The related theorems mention properties of matrices, co-rank, and dimension-like concepts, and some asymptotic bounds on probabilities.

### 2. Identifying Key Mathematical Objects

From the abstract:
- **Random Matrix**: An $n \times n$ matrix where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$.
- **Singularity**: The matrix is singular if its determinant is zero.
- **Probability of Singularity**: We want to bound this probability.

From the theorems:
- **Theorem about $\fmat$**: A matrix with fixed non-random rows and random discrete rows.
- **Reduction Theorem**: Relates primes and homomorphisms.
- **Dimension-like Theorems**: For matrices with small or large combinatorial dimensions.

### 3. Formulating a New Theorem or Conjecture

Given the abstract and the theorems, I can attempt to formulate a new theorem or conjecture based on the themes: random matrices, singularity probability, and asymptotic bounds.

**New Theorem**:
For a random $n \times n$ matrix $M$ where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$, the probability that $M$ is singular is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. The determinant of a random $n \times n$ matrix with entries $+1$ or $-1$ is a sum of $2^n$ terms, each being $\pm1$. The expectation of the absolute value of the determinant is $2^{n-1}$ (since the entries are symmetric). 
2. The variance is $\text{Var}(|det(M)|) = \text{E}(|det(M)|^2) - \text{E}(|det(M)|)^2 = 2^{n-1} (1 - 2^{-n})$. The standard deviation is $\sigma = \sqrt{2^{n-1} (1 - 2^{-n})}$.
3. By Chebyshev's inequality, $\Pr(|det(M)| \geq \text{E}(|det(M)|)) \leq 1/\sqrt{2}$ for large $n$.
4. Since the determinant is zero if $|det(M)| = 0$, and the probability of $|det(M)| = 0$ is negligible compared to the Chebyshev bound, the probability of singularity is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$.

### 4. Rigorously Formulating the New Theorem

**Theorem**:
Let $M_n$ be an $n \times n$ matrix where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$. Then, the probability that $M_n$ is singular satisfies
\[ \Pr(\det(M_n) = 0) \leq (1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n. \]

**Proof Sketch**:
1. The determinant of $M_n$ is $\pm1$ with probability $2^{1-n}$ each. The expected value of $|det(M_n)|$ is $2^{n-1}$.
2. As $n \to \infty$, the probability that $|det(M_n)|$ is $2^{n-1}$ approaches $1/2$ (since $|det(M_n)|$ is either $2^{n-1}$ or $0$ with probability $1/2$ and $1/2$ respectively).
3. By Chebyshev's inequality, for sufficiently large $n$, the probability that $|det(M_n)|$ is $0$ is at most the probability that $|det(M_n)|$ deviates from its mean by more than $\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
4. The standard deviation is $\sigma = \sqrt{2^{n-1} (1 - 2^{-n})}$. For large $n$, $\sigma \approx 2^{n-1}/2$, and the probability of singularity is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$.

### 5. Verifying the Rigorously Formulated Theorem

The theorem seems plausible based on the heuristic above. To make it rigorous:
- The expected determinant is $0$ for odd $n$ and $2^{n-1}$ for even $n$.
- The probability that $|det(M_n)| = 0$ is $2^{-n} \binom{n}{n/2}$ for even $n$ (binomial distribution approximation).
- For even $n$, this probability is $\Theta(2^{-n} \sqrt{n})$ (since $\binom{n}{n/2} \approx 2^{-n} \sqrt{n \pi n}$).
- The bound $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$ is $\approx (1/\sqrt{2})^n$ for large $n$, which is weaker than the binomial approximation for singular matrices. Thus, the original bound is not tight.

**Revised Theorem**:
The probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $O(2^{-n})$.

### 6. Conclusion

The theorem should be revised to reflect a more precise bound. The actual probability of singularity is $(1 + o(1)) \cdot 2^{-n}$ for random $n \times n$ matrices with entries $+1$ or $-1$. However, the original abstract's bound $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$ is incorrect. The correct bound is $O(2^{-n})$.

### 7. Final Theorem

**Theorem**:
For a random $n \times n$ matrix $M$ where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$, the probability that $M$ is singular is $O(2^{-n})$.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. The determinant of $M$ is zero only if the matrix is singular.
2. The probability that a random $n \times n$ matrix with entries $+1$ or $-1$ is singular is $2^{-n} \binom{n}{k}$ for some $k$, which is maximized when $k = n/2$.
3. The maximum probability is $\binom{n}{n/2} 2^{-n} \approx \Theta(\sqrt{n} \cdot 2^{-n})$ for even $n$.
4. Thus, the probability is $O(2^{-n})$.

### 8. Reconciling with Original Abstract

The original abstract's bound is $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$, which is incorrect for this problem. The correct bound is $O(2^{-n})$. The original theorem appears to be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

### 9. Corrected Theorem (Based on Original Abstract's Claim)

The original abstract states:
> the probability that $M_n$ is singular is at most $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$,
> improving on the previous best upper bound of $(3/4 + o(1))^n$.

This suggests that the original bound is tighter. However, the calculations show that $(3/4 + o(1))^n$ is the correct bound. The discrepancy may be due to the original abstract's claim needing a more careful analysis.

**Final Corrected Theorem**:
For a random $n \times n$ matrix $M$ where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$, the probability that $M$ is singular is at most $(3/4 + o(1))^n$.

### 10. Summary

The theorem should be revised from $(1/\sqrt{2} + o(1))^n$ to $(3/4 + o(1))^n$ based on the calculations and the Tao-Vu bound. The original theorem's bound seems incorrect or misstated. The correct bound is $(3/4 + o(1))^n$.

### 11. Final Answer

The correct theorem is:

**Theorem**:
For a random $n \times n$ matrix $M$ where each entry is independently $+1$ or $-1$, the probability that $M$ is singular is at most $(3/4 + o(1))^n$.

This matches the original abstract's bound and is the correct asymptotic upper bound. The proof is based on the Tao-Vu result.
