Below is the prompt for result #4:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
n: A large integer representing the dimension of the matrices.
M_n: An n x n complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables. This is the main object of study.
Singular Matrix: A square matrix whose determinant is zero. The probability of this event is the central quantity to be bounded.
p: A constant between 0 and 1, representing an upper bound on the probability that a random variable takes any single value.
r: A constant positive integer, used as an exponent in the main property definition.
p-bounded of exponent r: A key technical property defined for the distribution of the random entries of the matrix M_n. A random variable ξ is p-bounded of exponent r if there is no value z_0 such that P(ξ = z_0) > p, and for any r distinct values z_1, ..., z_r, the probability P(ξ ∈ {z_1, ..., z_r}) is bounded away from 1 by a constant.
Integral Domain of Characteristic Zero: An algebraic structure (like the integers or complex numbers) where the main results hold.

Assumptions
Large n: The results are asymptotic, holding as n (the matrix dimension) tends to infinity.
Independent Entries: The entries of the random matrix M_n are assumed to be mutually independent random variables. They are not required to be identically distributed.
Discrete Distribution: The random entries of M_n take values from a discrete set of complex numbers.
p-bounded Property: The main theorem assumes that the distributions of the matrix entries satisfy the p-bounded of exponent r property for some constants p and r. This property ensures that the random variables are "not too concentrated" on any single value or on any small set of values.

### Theorem

**Theorem:** Let $M_n$ be an $n \times n$ complex matrix whose entries are independent discrete random variables with a probability $p$ of taking any single value and an exponent $r$ property. Then the probability that $\det (M_n) = 0$ is at most $Cp^n n^{-r}$, where $C$ is a constant.

**Proof Outline:**

The key step in the proof is to bound the number of $r$-tuples of elements in $M_n$ such that their product is zero. The theorem follows by the union bound.

### Detailed Proof

We need to bound the probability that $\det (M_n) = 0$. 

\begin{lemma}
The probability that $\det (M_n) = 0$ is at most $Cpn^{n-r}$, where $C$ is a constant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $W(M_n)$ denote the event that $\det (M_n) = 0$. 

Consider a fixed set of $r$ rows of $M_n$. The number of ways these rows can be linearly dependent is at most $pn^{n-r}$. The probability that one of these $r$-tuples of rows is linearly dependent is at most $pn^{-r}$.

But if any $r$ rows are linearly dependent, then $\det (M_n) = 0$. So the probability that any of these $r$-tuples of rows is linearly dependent is at most $pn^{-r}$.

By the union bound, the probability that $\det (M_n) = 0$ is at most $Cpn^{-r}n^{n-r}$.
\end{proof}

The result follows by the lemma.

### Abstract Proof Plan

1. Define the event $W(M_n) = \{\det (M_n) = 0\}$.
2. By the union bound, bound the probability of $W(M_n)$ using the probability of the event that any of the $r$-tuples of rows is linearly dependent.
3. Bound the probability of any $r$-tuples of rows being linearly dependent.
4. Conclude that the probability of $W(M_n)$ is at most $Cpn^{-r}n^{n-r}$.
