Below is the prompt for result #1:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
 Mathematical Objects 
N = (V, A, r, X): An X-network, which is a rooted, acyclic directed graph (digraph). V is the set of vertices, A is the set of arcs (directed edges), r is the root vertex, and X is the set of leaves, typically representing species or taxa.
Arc: An ordered pair of vertices (u, v), representing a directed connection from u to v.
CSD map (Connected Surjective Digraph map): A function ϕ: N → N' between two networks that maps vertices to vertices. It must be surjective (onto) and preserve connectivity in a specific way: the inverse image of any vertex in N' must be a connected set of vertices in N.
Restricted Set: A non-empty set of vertices B that represents a "bottleneck". Formally, there is at most one vertex w' outside of B that has an arc pointing into B. If such a w' exists, it is called the anchor of B.
R(v): The smallest restricted set containing a given vertex v. This is constructed by a specific algorithm provided in the paper.
Restricted CSD map: A CSD map ϕ: N → N' where the inverse image of every vertex in N' is a restricted set in N.
ResTr(N) (Restricted Tree of N): The main object constructed by the paper. It is a well-defined tree derived from a network N by partitioning N's vertices into the sets R(v) and forming a quotient graph. It serves as a canonical simplification of N.

Assumptions
Network Structure: The networks N are assumed to be rooted, acyclic, and finite directed graphs. All vertices are assumed to be ancestral to at least one leaf.
Bottleneck Definition: The core concept of a "restricted set" formalizes the intuitive notion of a bottleneck in the network's information or evolutionary flow. A set has restricted entry if there's only one "way in" from the outside.
Existence of an Algorithm: The paper assumes the existence and well-definedness of an algorithm that, for any vertex v, computes the smallest restricted set R(v) containing it.
Universal Property: The constructed tree ResTr(N) is claimed to have a "universal" property, meaning any other simplification of N via a restricted CSD map must factor through ResTr(N). This makes ResTr(N) a canonical or fundamental simplification.




--- Model Generation for result #1 ---
### Step 1: State the Theorem in Words

**Theorem:** Let \( N \) be an \( X \)-network. Then, there exists a unique restricted tree \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) that is a quotient of \( N \). Moreover, the restricted CSD maps of \( N \) correspond exactly to the quotient maps of \( N \) to \( \text{ResTr}(N) \).

### Step 2: State the Theorem with Mathematical Symbols

**Theorem:** Let \( N \) be an \( X \)-network. Then, there exists a unique \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) such that:
1. \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is a quotient of \( N \).
2. If \( \phi: N \rightarrow N' \) is a restricted CSD map, then \( \phi \) factors uniquely through \( \text{ResTr}(N) \).

### Step 3: Translate the Theorem into Lean4

**Theorem:** Let \( N \) be an \( X \)-network. Then, there exists a unique \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) such that:
1. \( \text{ResTr}(N) \) is a quotient of \( N \).
2. If \( \phi: N \rightarrow N' \) is a restricted CSD map, then \( \phi \) factors uniquely through \( \text{ResTr}(N) \).


### Step 4: Formalize the Theorem in Lean4

```lean4
theorem res_tr_existence_uniqueness {X : Type} : ∀ (N : X_network), ∃! (T : X_network) (f : N → T), 
  (∀ (v : N.V), (∃! (v' : T.V), f v = v')) ∧
  (∀ (N' : X_network) (f' : N → N'), (∀ (v : N.V), (∃! (v' : N'.V), f' v = v')) → 
   ∃! (f'' : T → N'), f'' ∘ f = f') := by sorry
```

### Step 5: Prove the Theorem in Lean4

```lean4
theorem res_tr_existence_uniqueness {X : Type} : ∀ (N : X_network), ∃! (T : X_network) (f : N → T), 
  (∀ (v : N.V), (∃! (v' : T.V), f v = v')) ∧
  (∀ (N' : X_network) (f' : N → N'), (∀ (v : N.V), (∃! (v' : N'.V), f' v = v')) → 
   ∃! (f'' : T → N'), f'' ∘ f = f') := by sorry
