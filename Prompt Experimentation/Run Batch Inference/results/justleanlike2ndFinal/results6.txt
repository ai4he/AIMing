Below is the prompt for result #6:
Given the following objects and assumptions from a math paper please write a theorem that could be useful in proving the paper.

    Here are the objects and assumptions in the paper, you dont need to use all of them, but your theorem should be grounded in some of these elements:
Mathematical Objects 
G: A general graph.
n: The number of vertices in the graph G.
p: The probability that an edge exists between any pair of vertices in the random graph G_{n,p}.
G_{n,p}: A random graph with n vertices and edge probability p.
ccl(G): A function that returns the order (i.e., the number of vertices) of the largest complete minor in graph G.
b: A parameter defined as b := 1/(1-p).
ε (epsilon): An arbitrarily small positive constant used to frame the precision of the result (e.g., in (1 ± ε)).
C: A constant, whose value depends on ε, that defines the lower bound for the average degree (np) in the main theorem.
c: A fixed constant greater than 1, used to define the edge probability in the sparse case (p = c/n).
δ (delta): A constant, whose value depends on the constant c.

Assumptions
The results are presented as theorems that hold under specific constraints on the parameters. The key assumptions are the conditions stated in the "if" part of the theorems.
Asymptotic Analysis: All results are for the limit where n (the number of vertices) tends to infinity. The conclusions hold "asymptotically almost surely" (a.a.s.), meaning with a probability that approaches 1 as n grows.
Conditions on Edge Probability p:
For Corollary 1.3, it is assumed that the edge probability p is in the range C/n ≤ p ≤ 1-ε. This means the average degree (np) is at least some large constant C, and p is bounded away from 1.
For Theorem 1.4, it is assumed that the edge probability p is exactly p = c/n, where c is a fixed constant greater than 1. 




--- Model Generation for result #6 ---
### Formal Theorem


Theorem 1.1: The following statement holds asymptotically almost surely. 

\textbf{If} $n$ is sufficiently large and $C/n \leq p \leq 1 - \epsilon$, then $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le 8(1+\epsilon)\log_c n$ with high probability over the random choice of $G_{n,p}$.

Here $C$ is a constant whose value depends on $\epsilon$, and $c$ is a constant greater than 1.

The key contribution of this work is to show that the same bound holds when $p$ is set to $c/n$, i.e., the sparse regime of the random graph $G_{n,p}$. 

Theorem 1.2: The following statement holds asymptotically almost surely.

\textbf{If} $n$ is sufficiently large and $p = c/n$, then $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le 8\log_c n$ with high probability over the random choice of $G_{n,p}$.

Here $c$ is a constant greater than 1.

Since $G_{n,p}$ is a random graph, as the number of vertices $n$ grows, the edge probability $p$ is set to $c/n$. 

Theorem 1.3: The following statement holds asymptotically almost surely.

\textbf{If} $n$ is sufficiently large and $p = c/n$, then $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le 8\log_c n + 1$ with high probability over the random choice of $G_{n,p}$.

Here $c$ is a constant greater than 1.

The proof of this theorem follows from the proof of Theorem 1.2 and several additional technical arguments. The goal of this paper is to give a self-contained proof of Theorem 1.2, which is the foundation of Theorem 1.3.

Theorem 1.4: The following statement holds asymptotically almost surely.

\textbf{If} $n$ is sufficiently large and $p = c/n$, then $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le 8\log_c n - 1$ with high probability over the random choice of $G_{n,p}$.

Here $c$ is a constant greater than 1.

The proof of Theorem 1.4 is a more technical argument than the proofs of the main theorems. However, it is included here for the sake of completeness and to provide a more complete picture of the results.

\subsection{Introduction}

The proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the following well-known result about the largest clique in the random graph $G_{n,p}$:

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Theorem A:} \emph{The largest clique in $G_{n,p}$ is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(\log n)$.}

\noindent \textbf{Theorem B:} \emph{The largest clique minor in $G_{n,p}$ is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(\log n)$.}

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent Note that Theorem B implies Theorem 1.1 and thus completes the proof of Theorem 1.1. The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem B.

\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem 1.1}

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Proof of Theorem 1.1:} The proof of Theorem 1.1 follows immediately from Theorem A and Theorem B. Indeed, Theorem A implies that $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability, and Theorem B implies that $ccl(G_{n,p}) \ge \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability. Thus, it follows that $ccl(G_{n,p}) = \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1. $\Box$

\subsection{Proof of Theorem 2.1}

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \textbf{Proof of Theorem 2.1:} The proof of Theorem 2.1 follows immediately from Theorem 2.2. Indeed, Theorem 2.2 implies that $ccl(G_{n,p}) \le \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability, and Theorem 2.1 implies that $ccl(G_{n,p}) \ge \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability. Thus, it follows that $ccl(G_{n,p}) = \Theta(\log n)$ with high probability. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1. $\Box$
