In \\cite{chen},\n","the authors determined the heterochromatic tree partition number\n","of an $r$-edge-colored complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$. In this\n","paper we consider an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_{n}$ and give\n","the exact expression for its heterochromatic tree partition number. \\\\\n","\n","Before proceeding, we introduce some definitions and notations.\n","Throughout this paper, we use $r$ to denote the number of the\n","colors, and an $r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ means that each\n","color appears at least once in $G$. Let $\\phi$ be an\n","$r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$. For an edge $e\\in E(G)$, denote\n","by $\\phi(e)$ the color of $e$. Denote by $t_r(G, \\phi)$ the\n","minimum positive integer $p$ such that under the $r$-edge-coloring\n","$\\phi$, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$\n","vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. Clearly, $t_r(G)=\\max\n","_{\\phi} t_r(G, \\phi)$, where $\\phi$ runs over all\n","$r$-edge-colorings of the graph $G$. Let $\\phi$ be an\n","$r$-edge-coloring of the graph $G$ and $F$ be a spanning forest of\n","$G$, each component of which is a heterochromatic tree. If $F$\n","contains exactly $t_r(G, \\phi)$ components, then $F$ is called an\n","{\\it optimal heterochromatic tree partition} of the graph $G$ with\n","edge-coloring $\\phi$. Note that a tree consisting of a single\n","vertex is also regarded as a heterochromatic tree. \\\\\n","\n","For any integer $r\\geq 2$, there is a unique positive integer $t$,\n","such that ${t\\choose 2} +2\\leq r\\leq {{t+1}\\choose 2} +1$.\n","Clearly, the integer $t$ is determined completely by $r$, and here\n","we denote it by $f(r)=t$. This integer $f(r)=t$ will play an\n","important role in expressing the number $t_r(K_n)$. If the color\n","number $r=1$, clearly a maximum matching (plus a single vertex\n","when $n$ is odd) in $K_n$ is an optimal heterochromatic tree\n","partition, and then $t_r(K_n)=\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$.

Also, no (monochromatic) partition number of an\n","$r$-edge-colored graph $K_{n}$ or $K_{n,n}$ is determined exactly.\n","The only exception is due to Kaneko, Kano and Suzuki \\cite{kks},\n","who gave an explicit expression for the (monochromatic) tree\n","partition number of a 2-edge-colored complete multipartite graph.\n","In particular, let $n_1, n_2, \\cdots, n_k$ ($k\\geq 2$) be integers\n","such that $1\\leq n_1\\leq n_2\\leq \\cdots \\leq n_k$ and let $n=n_1+\n","n_2+\\cdots +n_{k-1}, m=n_k$.

The {\\it\n","heterochromatic tree partition number} of an $r$-edge-colored\n","graph $G$, denoted by $t_r(G)$, is defined to be the minimum\n","positive integer $p$ such that whenever the edges of the graph $G$\n","are colored with $r$ colors, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by\n","at most $p$ vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. In \\cite{chen},\n","the authors determined the heterochromatic tree partition number\n","of an $r$-edge-colored complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$. In this\n","paper we consider an $r$-edge-colored complete graph $K_{n}$ and give\n","the exact expression for its heterochromatic tree partition number. \\\\\n","\n","Before proceeding, we introduce some definitions and notations.\n","Throughout this paper, we use $r$ to denote the number of the\n","colors, and an $r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ means that each\n","color appears at least once in $G$. Let $\\phi$ be an\n","$r$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$. For an edge $e\\in E(G)$, denote\n","by $\\phi(e)$ the color of $e$. Denote by $t_r(G, \\phi)$ the\n","minimum positive integer $p$ such that under the $r$-edge-coloring\n","$\\phi$, the vertices of $G$ can be covered by at most $p$\n","vertex-disjoint heterochromatic trees. Clearly, $t_r(G)=\\max\n","_{\\phi} t_r(G, \\phi)$, where $\\phi$ runs over all\n","$r$-edge-colorings of the graph $G$. Let $\\phi$ be an\n","$r$-edge-coloring of the graph $G$ and $F$ be a spanning forest of\n","$G$, each component of which is a heterochromatic tree. If $F$\n","contains exactly $t_r(G, \\phi)$ components, then $F$ is called an\n","{\\it optimal heterochromatic tree partition} of the graph $G$ with\n","edge-coloring $\\phi$. Note that a tree consisting of a single\n","vertex is also regarded as a heterochromatic tree. \\\\\n","\n","For any integer $r\\geq 2$, there is a unique positive integer $t$,\n","such that ${t\\choose 2} +2\\leq r\\leq {{t+1}\\choose 2} +1$.\n","Clearly, the integer $t$ is determined completely by $r$, and here\n","we denote it by $f(r)=t$. This integer $f(r)=t$ will play an\n","important role in expressing the number $t_r(K_n)$. If the color\n","number $r=1$, clearly a maximum matching (plus a single vertex\n","when $n$ is odd) in $K_n$ is an optimal heterochromatic tree\n","partition, and then $t_r(K_n)=\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$. So, in\n","the rest of this paper we only consider the case $2\\leq r\\leq\n","{n\\choose 2}$.
