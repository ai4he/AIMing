The problem of finding\n","sufficient conditions for the existence of an independent transversal, in terms of the\n","ratio between the part sizes and the maximum degree $\\Delta$ of the graph, dates back to\n","1975, when it was raised by Bollob\\'as, Erd\\H{o}s, and Szemer\\'edi \\cite{BES}.  Since\n","then, much work has been done \\cite{ABZ, Al-problems-results, Al-strong-chromatic,\n","  Ha-note, Ha-strong-chromatic, HS, Ji, Me, ST, Yu}, and this basic concept has also\n","appeared in several other contexts, such as linear arboricity \\cite{Al-linear-arboricity},\n","vertex list coloring \\cite{Re, RS, BH}, and cooperative coloring \\cite{AH, LS}.  In the\n","general case, it was proved by Haxell \\cite{Ha-note} that an independent transversal\n","exists as long as all parts have size at least $2\\Delta$. The sharpness of this bound was\n","shown by Szab\\'o and Tardos \\cite{ST}, extending earlier results of \\cite{Ji} and \\cite{Yu}.\n","On the other hand, we proved in \\cite{LS} that the upper bound can be further reduced\n","to $(1+o(1))\\Delta$ if no vertex has more than $o(\\Delta)$ neighbors in any single part.\n","Such a condition arises naturally in certain applications, e.g., vertex list coloring.\n","\n","In the case when all of the $V_i$ are of the same size $k$, it is natural to ask when it\n","is possible to find not just one, but $k$ disjoint independent transversals with respect\n","to the $\\{V_i\\}$.  This is closely related to the following notion of strong colorability. Given a\n","graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$ dividing $n$, we say that $G$ is\n","\\emph{strongly $k$-colorable}\\/ if for every partition of $V(G)$ into disjoint sets $V_1\n","\\cup \\ldots \\cup V_r$, all of size exactly $k$, there exists a proper vertex $k$-coloring of\n","$G$ with each color appearing exactly once in each $V_i$. Notice that $G$ is strongly\n","$k$-colorable iff the chromatic number of any graph obtained from $G$ by adding a union of\n","vertex disjoint $k$-cliques is $k$. If $k$ does not divide $n$,\n","then we say that $G$ is strongly $k$-colorable if the graph obtained by adding $k\n","\\big\\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\big\\rceil - n$ isolated vertices is strongly $k$-colorable.  The\n","\\emph{strong chromatic number}\\/ of $G$, denoted $s\\chi(G)$, is the minimum $k$ for which\n","$G$ is strongly $k$-colorable.\n","\n","The concept of strong chromatic number first appeared independently in work by Alon\n","\\cite{Al-linear-arboricity} and Fellows \\cite{Fe}.  It was also the crux of the\n","longstanding ``cycle plus triangles'' problem popularized by Erd\\H{o}s, which was to\n","show that the strong chromatic number of the cycle on $3n$ vertices is three. That\n","problem was solved by Fleischner and Stiebitz \\cite{FS-c3n}.  The strong\n","chromatic number is known \\cite{Fe} to be monotonic in the sense that strong\n","$k$-colorability implies strong $(k+1)$-colorability. It is also easy to see that $s\\chi(G)$\n","must always be strictly greater than the maximum degree $\\Delta$:\n","simply take $V_1$ to be the neighborhood of a vertex of maximal degree,\n","and partition the rest of the vertices arbitrarily. The intriguing question of bounding the strong chromatic\n","number in terms of the maximum degree has not yet been answered\n","completely. Alon \\cite{Al-strong-chromatic} showed that there exists a constant $c$ such\n","that $s\\chi \\leq c\\Delta$ for every graph.  Later, Haxell \\cite{Ha-strong-chromatic}\n","improved the bound by showing that it is enough to use $c=3$, and in fact even $c=3-\\ep$\n","for $\\ep$ up to $1/4$ \\cite{Ha-private-comm}.  On the other hand, Fleischner and Stiebitz \\cite{FS-2d}\n","observed that the disjoint union of complete bipartite graphs $K_{\\Delta, \\Delta}$ cannot be strongly $(2\\Delta-1)$-colored.\n","Indeed, put each part of one of the $K_{\\Delta, \\Delta}$ into the sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, respectively.\n","Then these $2\\Delta$ vertices should get different colors. It is believed that this lower bound is tight and\n","the strong chromatic number of any graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ should be at most $2\\Delta$.\n","\n","It is natural to wonder what is the asymptotic behavior of the strong chromatic number for\n","the random graph $\\gnp$, relative to the maximum degree of the graph. As usual, $\\gnp$ is\n","the probability space of all labeled graphs on $n$ vertices, where every edge appears\n","randomly and independently with probability $p=p(n)$. We say that the random graph\n","possesses a graph property $\\cal P$ {\\em almost surely}, or a.s.\\ for brevity, if the\n","probability that $\\gnp$ satisfies $\\cal P$ tends to 1 as $n$ tends to infinity. One of the\n","most interesting phenomena discovered in the study of random graphs is that many natural\n","graph invariants are highly concentrated (see, e.g., \\cite {Ma} for the result on the\n","clique number and \\cite{SS, Lu, AK} for the concentration of the chromatic number). In\n","this paper we show that the strong chromatic number is another example of a tightly\n","concentrated graph parameter.  For dense random graphs, it turns out that we can\n","concentrate $s\\chi(\\gnp)$ on a single value, and for some smaller values of $p$ we were\n","only able to determine $s\\chi(\\gnp)$ asymptotically. In the statement of our first result,\n","and in the rest of this paper, the notation $f(n) \\gg g(n)$ means that $f/g \\rightarrow\n","\\infty$ together with $n$.  Also, all logarithms are in the natural base $e$.\n","\n","\\begin{theorem}\n","  \\label{thm:main}\n","  Let $\\Delta$ be the maximum degree of the random graph $\\gnp$, where $p \u003c 1-\\theta$\n","  for any arbitrary constant $\\theta \u003e 0$.\n","  \\begin{description}\n","  \\item[\\hspace{12pt}\\textbf{(i)}] If $p \\gg \\left(\\frac{\\log^4 n}{n}\\right)^{1/3}$, then\n","almost surely the strong chromatic\n","    number of $\\gnp$ equals $\\Delta+1$.\n","\\item[\\hspace{12pt}\\textbf{(ii)}] If $p \\gg \\left(\\frac{\\log n}{n}\\right)^{1/2}$, then a.s.\\ the strong chromatic\n","    number of $\\gnp$ is $(1+o(1))\\Delta$.\n","  \\end{description}\n","\\end{theorem}\n","\n","Unfortunately, our approach breaks down completely when $p \\ll n^{-1/2}$.

By\n","Lemma \\ref{lem:span-few-edges}, $V_{I_t}$ induces less than $(120\\ep^{-1}\\log^2\n","n)|V_{I_t}|$ edges.

To define $I_{t+1}$ we consider the following process.\n","Start with $I_{t+1}$ to be the set of all $i \\in I_t$ for which $V_i$ has more than\n","$\\frac{\\ep}{4} \\Delta$ vertices that have $\u003e \\frac{\\Delta}{\\log \\Delta}$ neighbors in\n","$V_{I_t}$.

As above, Lemma \\ref{lem:span-few-edges} ensures that this process must stop\n","before $I_{t+1}$ doubles in size.  Therefore in the end we have\n","\\begin{eqnarray*}\n","  |I_{t+1}|  \u0026\\leq\u0026  2 \\left(\\frac{\\ep}{4}\\Delta\\right)^{-1} \\cdot 2 \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\log\n","      \\Delta}\\right)^{-1} \\cdot (120\\ep^{-1}\\log^2 n)|V_{I_t}| \\\\\n","\u0026\\leq\u0026  O\\left( \\frac{\\log^2 n\\, \\log \\Delta}{\\Delta^2}|V_{I_t}|\\right) \\ \\leq \\\n","O\\left( \\frac{\\log^2 n \\, \\log \\Delta}{\\Delta}|I_t|\\right)\\\\\n"," \u0026\\ll\u0026 \\frac{1}{\\log n} |I_t|.\n","\\end{eqnarray*}\n","Clearly, $|I_1| \\leq r \\leq n$.  Therefore, when $t \\geq \\frac{2\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$,\n","$I_t$ will be empty.  Let $\\sigma$ be the smallest index such that $I_\\sigma = \\emptyset$.  We now\n","recursively build partial independent transversals $T_\\sigma, \\ldots, T_1$, where $T_t$ is\n","an independent transversal on $V_{I_t}$.

Suppose that we\n","have $T_1$ as described above.  Let $J_1$ be the set of all indices $j \\not \\in I_1$ such\n","that some $v \\in T_1$ is locally big with respect to $V_j$.

Since\n","$|T_1|=|I_1|$ and each vertex can be locally big with respect to at most $(1+o(1))\\log n$\n","sets $V_i$, we have that initially $|J_1| \\leq (1+o(1))|I_1| \\log n \\leq 50 \\ep^{-1}p^{-1}\n","\\log^2 n$.  Therefore as before, Lemma \\ref{lem:span-few-edges} ensures that this process\n","stops before $J_1$ doubles in size, so the final set $J_1$ has size at most $100\n","\\ep^{-1}p^{-1} \\log^2 n$.\n","\n","As before, we construct a sequence of nested index sets $J_1 \\supset \\cdots \\supset J_\\tau\n","= \\emptyset$, where for $t \\geq 1$, define $J_{t+1}$ in terms of $J_t$ as follows.

Lemma \\ref{lem:span-few-edges} again ensures that we stop before $J_{t+1}$\n","doubles in size, and the same computation as we did for $I_{t+1}$ shows that $|J_{t+1}|\n","\\ll \\frac{1}{\\log n} |J_t|$. Thus when $t \\geq \\frac{2 \\log n}{\\log \\log n}$, $J_t$ is\n","empty. Let $\\tau$ be the smallest index for which $J_\\tau = \\emptyset$.\n","\n","Next, delete all neighbors of $T_1$ in $V_{J_1}$ and all vertices in $V_{J_1}$ that are\n","locally big with respect to any $V_k$ with $k \\not \\in I_1$.  Denote the resulting sets\n","$V'_j$, $j \\in J_1$. We claim that each $V'_j$ still has size at least $\\frac{\\ep}{2}\n","\\Delta$.  Indeed, at most one $v \\in T_1$ can be locally big with respect to $V_j$,\n","because $T_1$ is an independent set and all vertices that are locally big with respect to\n","the same part were connected by our construction.
